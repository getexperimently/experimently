Docs: {heading_guide}, step {step_number} ("{heading_step}") fails as written

Step {step_number} of {guide_path} failed in {count_runs} runs in a row, the last at commit {sha}.

What to do: open step {step_number} of this guide's report in the latest run, {run_link}, where the expectation written before the run and what a reader sees are side by side; then tick below which one is wrong, and fix it.

- Guide: {guide_path}, as published at commit {sha}
- Step {step_number}: "{heading_step}"
- What the guide says, what was expected (written before the run), and what a reader sees: step {step_number} of the report in {run_link}
- Reproduce: follow steps 1 to {step_number} of the guide on the stack it names, at commit {sha}

Which is wrong (tick one):

- [ ] the guide
- [ ] the product
- [ ] undecided

One defect per issue: another failing step in this guide gets its own issue.
