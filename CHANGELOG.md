# Changelog

Notable changes to Experimently. Dates are release dates.

This file is written by hand, and is a carry-over from when this repository
was published by exporting a private one: release-please ran there, and its
commit links pointed at hashes this repository does not contain, because the
export rewrote history. Development moved here on 2026-09-25, so that no
longer applies and release-please can generate this file directly. Until it
does, entries below 0.2.2 are hand-written and the links in them are the
reason why.

### Documentation

* **dashboard:** one table says what the dashboard does and what is API-only, and a check keeps it true ([#889](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/889)) ([781c2d9](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/781c2d9b1d6c857068ca6707fa2b1cd87739eab3))

## [0.21.0](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/compare/v0.20.0...v0.21.0) (2026-10-04)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **results:** `GET /results/{id}/cuped` uses each user's own events in the `covariate_lookback_days` (default 7) before their assignment as the covariate, instead of their position in the order of assignment, so `theta`, `variance_reduction_pct` and every `adjusted_*` value change for experiments set to `cuped` or `cuped_plus`. `metrics` has one entry per metric and treatment (`variant_id`, `variant_name`) instead of one for the first treatment; intervals use the experiment's `confidence_level`, and `corrected_p_value` applies its `correction_method`. A metric that cannot be computed is listed with `unavailable_reason` instead of being left out. `none` numbers are unchanged apart from the confidence level; `winsorization` on a conversion metric is listed with `winsorization_needs_mean_metric` instead of numbers that clipped every conversion to 0 below a 1% rate.

### Features

* **audit:** automatic changes record who made them: the schedulers, the safety monitor and Cognito sign-in ([#851](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/851)) ([010d314](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/010d314f39afdf305a25bf878edc2b61971748b9))
* **audit:** export the audit log as CSV or JSON, and label, filter and download it on the dashboard ([#861](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/861)) ([c64ad44](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/c64ad44e16073966c877c21db9ab3993bc0f55b2))
* **deploy:** api_serving.py --explain names why it answered as it did ([#862](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/862)) ([23a92c6](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/23a92c67ee953a4b7bf5aa997d5fa9da81b54616))
* **deploy:** the rollback's stop step records what it stopped and how its wait ended ([#864](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/864)) ([45523d1](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/45523d13dea4dfa90cf54022344e644c53b26d5c))
* **results:** CUPED adjusts for each user's own events before assignment ([#856](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/856)) ([bb2f432](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/bb2f4322bdbef82a14294cbd7739dbb197cd8928))
* **segments:** a segment can be a list of user ids, with routes to add and remove members ([#858](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/858)) ([756885e](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/756885e9de204cd46bc7fab2b1ba88d685fd9de4))


### Bug Fixes

* **interactions:** /scan answers 500 when its database reads fail ([#857](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/857)) ([75dd8c1](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/75dd8c1717c865fcadaa834cba9da97808c435ad))
* **warehouse:** read real Snowflake answers (Z offset, SHOW COLUMNS null?) ([#863](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/863)) ([3d8a041](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/3d8a041ba19210a3d73f1489b03d4b40d902c2b2))


### Documentation

* **sdk:** the Python SDK installs from PyPI ([#865](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/865)) ([ba721e5](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/ba721e5ca1bd12bb38a5bae042d8aae37784484d))

## [0.20.0](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/compare/v0.19.0...v0.20.0) (2026-10-04)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **holdout:** the stable `PUT /api/v1/holdout/{holdout_id}` now refuses, with 422, a `holdout_percentage` different from the stored one once the holdout has been active (the same value is still accepted). It also refuses, with 422, `is_active: true` on a holdout that has been deactivated. `POST /api/v1/holdout` with `is_active: true` now deactivates the holdout that was active. A concurrent activation that the database's one-active index refuses answers 409. Accepted pre-launch under D30 and D48, on the T80 precedent (T126).

### Features

* **audit:** every core route that changes something records it in the audit log ([#846](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/846)) ([9ea0248](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/9ea0248d34ec5a67662ad192b4896f6c9602e457))
* **holdout:** record who each holdout covers, and fix its percentage once it is active ([#844](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/844)) ([1ea1874](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/1ea1874a270d34bc3e3f3bae9368672e9fc337ad))
* **tracking:** accept events that name no experiment or flag, as pre-experiment history ([#850](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/850)) ([a308702](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/a3087026e6fd955b3399a839517418d625c72f4b))
* **tracking:** assign up to 1,000 users to an experiment in one call ([#849](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/849)) ([1c76c0d](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/1c76c0d785c3dbfa2dab8f6426a5e7af176f1158))

## [0.19.0](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/compare/v0.18.0...v0.19.0) (2026-10-04)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **experiments:** each experiment stores a `correction_method` and a `confidence_level`, and results for experiments with several treatments now use the stored correction: Benjamini-Hochberg at 0.95 unless an experiment is created with others. Existing experiments are backfilled to Benjamini-Hochberg at 0.95. `GET /results/{id}?correction_method=none` shows the earlier, uncorrected numbers. Both fields are locked once an experiment leaves draft, for every role. `adjusted_p_value` is now filled in (equal to `p_value`) for experiments with one treatment. The data export and the report follow the stored setting. CUPED and sequential testing do not follow the stored level.
* **segments:** segment rules must use the targeting rule format (`{"logical_operator", "groups": [{"conditions": [...]}]}`). The old `{"operator", "conditions"}` segment format is refused with 422 on `POST /api/v1/segments`, `PUT /api/v1/segments/{id}` and preview, and `POST /api/v1/segments/{id}/evaluate` answers 409 for a segment stored in that format (bulk-evaluate answers `false`). `{segment_id}` path parameters must be UUIDs.
* **workspaces:** the workspace API-key routes are removed and answer 404 (platform API keys are unchanged); workspace create and update refuse `plan` with 422, and workspace responses no longer carry plan limits or counts.

### Features

* **dashboard:** set and see each experiment's confidence level and correction ([#845](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/845)) ([b7e4621](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/b7e46216c299f0b56eaa398e4802b9b7db67a4c5))
* **experiments:** each experiment stores its correction method and confidence level (Benjamini-Hochberg, 95% by default) ([#843](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/843)) ([f4bd9ea](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/f4bd9eac5d929aac821311b2c8966de1265b8b57))
* **workspaces:** remove workspace API keys and plan limits ([#829](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/829)) ([c3320b1](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/c3320b18b22fd140ec6d192024f000a55cfb2196))

## [0.17.0](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/compare/v0.16.2...v0.17.0) (2026-10-02)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **api:** feature-flag targeting rules are validated when saved ([#743](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/743))
* **flags:** a legacy targeting condition with an operator outside eq/ne/gt/lt/contains/in no longer matches ([#740](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/740))
* **safety:** A safety rollback to 0% now turns the flag off for every user, including users matched by a targeting rule, and pauses the flag's rollout schedule. A rollback to 1–100% still lowers only the global rollout. This supersedes the #706 note that rule-matched users keep the flag.
* **events:** event times stored with a non-UTC offset are rewritten to the same instant in UTC (+00:00). The downgrade cannot restore the original offsets, so take a snapshot before upgrading. Do not kill a long-running migration: it commits batch by batch and the next upgrade resumes it. A converting user's first-conversion day in the daily results can move by one day; totals do not change.
* **safety:** rollback_percentage on the safety config and the rollback route's percentage parameter accept 0–100; other values now answer 422. A stored value outside that range is clamped when used.
* **api:** During a concurrent change by another administrator, PUT /api/v1/admin/users/{id}, PUT /api/v1/users/{id}, both DELETE routes and PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/{id} can answer 400 "Inactive user" or 403 "Not enough permissions" instead of 200/204. A database lock wait on these routes is bounded; a request that waits longer answers 500.
* **api:** an archived feature flag can no longer be turned on directly. `PUT /api/v1/feature-flags/{id}` with `is_active: true`, `POST /api/v1/feature-flags/{id}/activate`, `POST /api/v1/feature-flags/{id}/enable` and `POST /api/v1/feature-flags/{id}/toggle` answered 200 and made an archived flag ACTIVE. They now answer 400 with the detail "This flag is archived. Unarchive it before turning it on." and leave the flag archived. `POST /api/v1/feature-flags/bulk-toggle` with `enable` reports an archived flag with `success: false` and that sentence as its error, and processes the other flags. `POST /api/v1/feature-flags/{id}/deactivate`, `/disable` and bulk-toggle `disable` used to move an archived flag to INACTIVE; they now answer 200 and leave it ARCHIVED. The way out is the new beta route `POST /api/v1/feature-flags/{id}/unarchive`, which moves an archived flag to INACTIVE.
* **api:** PUT /api/v1/admin/users/{id} and PUT /api/v1/users/{id} refuse, with 400, a request that removes the caller's own superuser access or deactivates the caller's own account. Resending the stored values is unchanged.
* **api:** a feature flag created without `is_active` is now off; send `"is_active": true` to create it on. Flag create and update refuse unknown fields with 422, refuse an explicit null on `key`, `name`, `is_active`, `rollout_percentage` and `default_value`, and refuse a `status` that differs from the flag's. `default_value` accepts only `false`; `true` answers 422. Flag responses no longer carry `rules` (use `targeting_rules`), `variants`, `metrics` or `last_evaluated`, and `owner_id` is null rather than the string `"None"` when the flag has no owner. A safety rollback still lowers only the global rollout percentage: users matched by a targeting rule keep the flag ([#629](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/629)).
* **auth:** under AUTH_PROVIDER=cognito, POST /api/v1/auth/signup and /api/v1/auth/confirm answer 404 unless COGNITO_SELF_SIGNUP_ENABLED=true.
* **results:** on GET /api/v1/results/{experiment_id}/sample-size, `required_sample_size_per_variant`, `achieved_power` and `baseline_rate` may now be null (200 with `unavailable_reason` when there is nothing to plan from). When `baseline_conversion_rate` is omitted the plan now starts from the control variant's observed rate instead of a fixed 0.1, and `current_sample_size_per_variant` is the smallest variant instead of the total divided by two. `SampleSizeResult` gains the required fields `alpha` and `comparisons`, and `guide_only_reasons` among the new optional ones.
* **auth:** under AUTH_PROVIDER=cognito, a sign-in is linked to its account by the Cognito user ID, stored as users.external_id = "cognito:<sub>". An account that has the Cognito username but is not linked is not used: this covers accounts created by earlier Cognito sign-ins, accounts with a password on the platform, and accounts linked to another identity. Until an administrator links it (docs/cognito_integration.md, "Linking an existing account"), the sign-in answers 401. A first sign-in from an identity with no email address, or with an address another account already has in any letter case, is refused. Roles come from the groups in the user's access token (the cognito:groups claim), so a group change takes effect at the user's next access token. ```
* **auth:** COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID and COGNITO_CLIENT_ID are both required under AUTH_PROVIDER=cognito; with either unset every sign-in is refused. A token issued to a different app client is refused.
* **users:** an upgrade refuses while two accounts' email addresses differ only in letter case. Nothing is changed; resolve the accounts it names by id with docs/self-hosting/migrations.md#email-addresses-that-differ-only-in-case, then run the upgrade again.
* **experiments:** PUT /api/v1/experiments/{id} answers 400 instead of 403 when the experiment's state does not allow the change; 403 now means only that the caller's role may not update experiments. `schedule` on PUT /api/v1/experiments/{id} is refused with 422 whatever its value; schedule an experiment with PUT /api/v1/experiments/{id}/schedule.
* **users:** POST /api/v1/users/, PUT /api/v1/users/{id} and PUT /api/v1/admin/users/{id} answer 409 "Email already registered" when another account holds the address in any letter case (previously a case variant was accepted).
* **experiments:** DELETE /api/v1/experiments/{id} on a non-DRAFT experiment answers 400 (was 403), same detail; a caller without permission still gets 403.
* **users:** UserResponse.email may be null (GET/PUT /api/v1/users/{id}, GET /api/v1/users/, GET /api/v1/users/me, GET /api/v1/admin/users, GET/PUT /api/v1/admin/users/{id}).
* **experiments:** PUT /api/v1/experiments/{id}/schedule on a DRAFT experiment now keeps a start_date or end_date the request omits; send null to clear it (previously an omitted date was cleared). schedule.time_zone must be an IANA zone name of at most 64 characters, on /schedule and inside PUT /api/v1/experiments/{id}; anything else answers 422 (on PUT /experiments/{id} an unknown name was previously accepted and ignored).
* **experiments:** each experiment's partial rollout admits its own users ([#587](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/587))
* **analysis:** `POST /api/v1/results/{experiment_id}/post-stratification` now answers 501 "not available yet" for every existing experiment (unknown experiment 404, malformed body 422, unchanged) and is marked beta.

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0) (2026-09-28)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **warehouse:** warehouse analysis tables; saved warehouse connections are removed ([#322](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/322))
* **api:** a staging or production API with neither `CORS_ORIGINS` nor `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` set no longer allows the localhost origins. A browser client on another origin (a local dashboard or demo app, or a site running the browser SDK) needs its origin in `CORS_ORIGINS` (Helm: `corsOrigins`), or in `DASHBOARD_ORIGINS` for a dashboard on its own host. Cross-origin responses no longer carry `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`. Development and test are unchanged.
* **api:** POST /api/v1/openfeature/evaluate and POST /api/v1/openfeature/bulk-evaluate are removed and now answer 404. They could not evaluate an existing flag (they read a FeatureFlag.enabled attribute the model does not have), and neither provider called them. The OpenFeature providers use GET /api/v1/feature-flags/evaluate/{key} and are unaffected. GET /api/v1/openfeature/flags is deprecated and unchanged.

### Features

* **modules:** a bounded outbound layer for warehouse connectors ([#321](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/321)) ([24b9958](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/24b995842073fa52abdbc0cbb56bdd757125abdd))

### Documentation

* **workspaces:** describe workspaces as grouping, not an access boundary ([#262](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/262)) ([a350ba2](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/commit/a350ba20e429ba453895f1ca6cfeb236eb46d77f))

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0) (2026-09-27)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **rules:** regex targeting conditions (`regex` in the dashboard, `match_regex` in the rules engine) now use RE2 syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax), which differs from Python's:
    - `\w`, `\d`, `\s` and `\b` match ASCII only.
    - `$` matches only at the very end of the value, not before a final
    newline.
    - These are refused: lookahead and lookbehind, backreferences, `\Z`,
    `(?x)`, `(?u)`, `(?a)`, `\N{...}`, counted repetitions over 1000, and
    very large Unicode repetitions such as `[\p{L}\p{N}]{1,300}`.
    - Values longer than 256 characters are not evaluated.

    When a stored pattern is refused, or a value is longer than 256 characters
    or cannot be encoded as UTF-8, the rules holding it are not applied: the
    feature flag evaluates disabled with reason "error" (no fall-through to its
    rollout percentage), the user is ineligible for the experiment and gets the
    control variant, and the user is not a member of the segment.

    After upgrading, run `python -m backend.scripts.check_regex_rules` to list
    stored patterns that RE2 refuses or that use `\w`, `\d`, `\s`, `\b` or `$`.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0) (2026-09-26)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **infra:** an environment deployed before this change cannot be updated in place -- the ECS cluster rename changes an export the fargate stack imports, and CloudFormation refuses that. For each such environment: `cdk destroy --exclusively experimentation-fargate-<env>`, delete the log groups /ecs/experimentation-backend-<env> and /ecs/experimentation-dashboard-<env> that the old template retained, then `cdk deploy experimentation-compute-<env>`, `cdk deploy experimentation-fargate-<env>`, and `cdk deploy --all`. The analytics stack is not destroyed. See docs/self-hosting/cdk.md, "Moving an environment deployed before the rename".

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-24

The first public release.

### Assignment now agrees across every implementation

The API and the Lambda assigned the same user to different variants. Both now
use one consistent hash — MD5 of `{user_id}:{key}`, first four bytes read
little-endian, divided by 2^32 — pinned to the golden vectors in
`tests/sdk-contract/golden-vectors.json` that the SDKs are tested against.
Verified over 2,000 users with zero differing buckets.

If you ran an earlier build, **assignments may change on upgrade** for users
the two paths disagreed about. Results gathered before and after are not
directly comparable for an experiment that was live across the upgrade.

### Security

- `gunicorn` 21.2.0 → 22.0.0, closing two request-smuggling advisories.
- Cleared the critical `handlebars` advisory and every high-severity one in
  the SDK lockfiles.
- Two security groups that were open to the whole internet are closed.
- The experiments list endpoint enforces the LIST permission.

### Deployment

- The CDK dependency cycle is broken, and a real `cdk synth` runs on every
  pull request rather than a stubbed one.
- Rollbacks go through CodeDeploy, and a traffic shift is approved rather than
  assumed.
- Resource names are deterministic and consistent across trees — the ECS
  cluster, the ECR repository and one Glue catalog instead of two.
- The published images no longer include an arm64 build that could not run.

### Dashboard

- A public homepage at `/`, with every dashboard route still behind
  authentication.
- A rate-limited login now reads as a rate-limited login rather than a dead
  API.

### Documentation

Every documentation link in the dashboard pointed at a site that had never
been built. The docs now resolve, and the tree they point into has been
checked: no broken links or anchors, no API endpoint that does not exist, and
no code example importing something that is not there.

## 0.1.0

Internal only; never published.
