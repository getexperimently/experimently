"""The OIDC redirect_uri must not move when the Host header does (#220).

This is the value an authorization code is returned to. Built from
`request.base_url` it was built from the `Host` header and a scheme that
`X-Forwarded-Proto` can set, so a crafted request steered the code to an
attacker's host -- authorization-code interception.

`ALLOWED_HOSTS` refuses a foreign Host before this function runs, so these pin
the second of two locks. Worth having on its own terms even with no attacker:
an OIDC `redirect_uri` must match the IdP's registration EXACTLY, so deriving
it from whichever accepted host a given request used is a bug, and behind a
TLS-terminating proxy the request's own scheme is `http` and every URL built
from it is wrong.
