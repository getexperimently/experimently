"""
Real-time counter REST endpoints (P2-B).

Provides live experiment assignment / event / conversion counts backed by
DynamoDB atomic counters so dashboards can show up-to-date data without
waiting for batch analytics jobs.

Endpoints:
    GET  /api/v1/counters/{experiment_id}          — read all counters
    POST /api/v1/counters/{experiment_id}/increment — atomic single increment
    POST /api/v1/counters/bulk                      — atomic bulk increment
    POST /api/v1/counters/{experiment_id}/reset     — reset (ADMIN only)

Reading a counter needs nothing beyond a session; *writing* one needs UPDATE
on experiments (ADMIN, DEVELOPER or a superuser), because these counters are
the first source ``BanditScheduler`` consults for a bandit experiment's arm
statistics — a forged conversion here re-weights live traffic.  Resetting is
ADMIN only, as it discards data.

The single-write routes take ``{experiment_id}`` **and honour it**: the path
value is what is written, and a body naming a different experiment is a 400
rather than a write somewhere else (#95).  They did not used to, and the path
parameter reached nothing but an error message.  ``/bulk`` has no path
parameter, because each of its up-to-100 entries names its own experiment —
see the note on that route.
