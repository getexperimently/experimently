"""Which warehouse connectors a deployment may use.

A connector is **enabled** only once it has passed a check against a real
warehouse account, and enabling one is a one-line change to
:data:`ENABLED_CONNECTORS` in its own pull request, which carries that
evidence.  Until then the connector's code ships but cannot be used: it is
not offered for selection, and creating a connection of that type is refused
with 422 ``connector_disabled``.  There is no operator setting that overrides
this.
