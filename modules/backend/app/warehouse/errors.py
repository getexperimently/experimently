"""Warehouse failures as a fixed set of codes.

Every failure a warehouse call can produce is a :class:`WarehouseError`
carrying one :class:`WarehouseErrorCode`.  Its message is chosen from a table
in this file by the code; there is no way to give it free text.  Besides the
code it carries only short, structured fields -- the vendor's own error code,
the HTTP status, a request id -- and each of those is dropped unless it is a
short token of letters, digits and ``_ . : -``.

So a vendor's error *message*, an HTTP body or a driver exception's text has
no path into a response, into a message we raise, or into a log record:

* adapters map the vendor's structured code and the HTTP status to a
  :class:`WarehouseErrorCode` (:func:`error_for_status` is the fallback);
* :func:`sanitised` rebuilds an error outside any ``except`` block, so its
  traceback carries no chained exception;
* :func:`log_warehouse_error` logs the code and the structured fields, never
  ``str()`` of anything that came from upstream.
