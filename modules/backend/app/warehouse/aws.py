"""boto3 clients for the AWS services a connector uses, on fixed endpoints only.

:func:`make_client` is the one way a connector gets a boto3 client:

* only ``sts``, ``athena`` and ``glue``, only in a region from
  :data:`AWS_REGIONS` (committed data: botocore's regions for those services);
* boto3's own regional endpoint -- ``endpoint_url`` is never set, and a client
  whose resolved endpoint is anything but ``https://<service>.<region>.amazonaws.com``
  (an ``AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`` variable, a FIPS or dual-stack setting) is refused;
* no environment proxy (``proxies={}``);
* :func:`boto_config`'s limits: connect 5 s and each read 30 s, two attempts --
  and, under a :class:`~.deadlines.Deadline`, each limit capped at what the
  deadline has left and a single attempt unless two fit.  The limits are fixed
  when the client is built, so :func:`call` builds one per call;
* a ``before-send`` hook (:class:`BeforeSendGuard`) that refuses the call
  unless the request's host is that endpoint, every address it resolves to is
  public (the same rule as :func:`.egress.refused_address`), and the
  operation's deadline has time left.
