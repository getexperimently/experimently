"""
The modules' registration entry point: ``modules.register(hooks)``.

One ``register(hooks)`` that installs the optional modules into the core
application through the seam in :mod:`backend.app.core.hooks`: the modules'
settings, the nine model modules, the audit signer, the eight routers, the
OpenAPI tags, the five capabilities and the ten module names.
``backend/app/modules_loader.py`` calls it once per process, from whichever of
``modules.register`` and ``modules.backend.app.register`` it finds first
(``modules/__init__`` re-exports this function), and never by importing
anything else from here.

It exists so that the three places that consume the seam agree:

* ``db/bootstrap.py`` on a fresh database creates the module tables that the
  module routers need (without this, ``make dev`` on an empty database served
  ``/api/v1/workspaces`` against no ``workspaces`` table);
* every real process signs compliance audit events, not only the test suite
  (``hooks.audit_signer`` was the null signer everywhere except ``conftest``);
* ``GET /api/v1/modules`` and the routers describe the same deployment: the
  names passed to ``hooks.register_modules`` are exactly the modules whose
  routes and capabilities this function mounts.

A core build has no ``modules/`` directory at all, so it has neither this
module nor anything it names, and ``load_modules()`` reports the core profile.

The loader may ask for ``register(hooks, with_routers=False)``: everything a
*schema* needs and none of the API graph, which is what the bootstrap, alembic
and the test conftest go through.  See :func:`register`.

Nothing outside ``modules_loader`` (and ``modules/__init__``) may import this
module.

    Settings first: ``load_modules_settings()`` builds and validates the
    ``ModulesSettings``, and a placeholder ``AUDIT_HMAC_KEY`` in
    staging/production is refused *here* rather than in the core ``Settings``
    (issue #91) -- the loader records the failure, the running API continues
    on the core profile with an ERROR in the log, and the schema builders
    (bootstrap, alembic, the test conftest) refuse to build.

    Then the models, then everything that needs the API graph: the schema
    builders call this too, and the nine model modules are cheap and
    self-contained, while the endpoint modules pull in the whole service
    layer.  Ordering them this way keeps the part a schema tool needs ahead of
    the part most likely to fail on an endpoint-only dependency.

    ``with_routers=False`` stops before the API graph, and is what
    ``require_modules_or_absent()`` asks for on behalf of the three schema
    builders -- alembic's ``env.py``, ``db/bootstrap.py`` and the test
    conftest.  Importing the endpoint modules is ~99% of a registration's
    cost (3.5 s here when there were eleven, against 0.03 s for the seven
    model modules), and it buys a schema tool nothing: it pulls in FastAPI
    routers and client libraries that no ``Base.metadata`` and no migration
    touches.
    Every container start pays it inside the bootstrap's advisory lock, and so
    does every ``alembic upgrade``/``current``/``revision``.

    What a schema-only registration must still do is everything that decides
    what the *schema* is, and it does: the settings (so a bad secret is still
    the registration's failure) and the nine model modules (so
    ``Base.metadata`` holds the module tables and autogenerate does not
    propose dropping them).  The routers' own guarantee -- that an endpoint
    module which fails to import is caught by the loader rather than by
    ``apply_routers`` -- is unaffected, because the process that builds a
    router asks for a registration ``with_routers=True``, which re-runs this
