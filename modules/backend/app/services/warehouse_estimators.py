"""The estimators a warehouse run computes its results with.

Warehouse analysis does not have a statistics engine of its own.  A
proportion metric's result comes from the function ``/results`` uses,
:func:`backend.app.services.sufficient_stats_analysis.binomial_metric_result`,
called with the counts the warehouse returned: units and converting units per
variant.  On identical counts the two paths give identical numbers.

A mean metric's result comes from
:func:`backend.app.services.sufficient_stats_analysis.mean_metric_result`,
called with the grand mean ``k`` and each variant's unit count and sums of
``y - k`` and ``(y - k) ** 2``, exactly as the warehouse returned them.

Nothing here computes a p-value, an interval or an effect size.
