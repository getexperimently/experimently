"""Request bodies for warehouse connections.

A connection names a warehouse and the read-only identity the platform uses
there, plus the limits every query is held to.  The body is the only place a
credential can arrive: no route takes one as a query or path parameter, and
the one secret a body can carry (a BigQuery service-account key) is
write-only -- it is encrypted before it is stored and no response returns it.
Snowflake connections carry no secret at all: the platform generates the key
pair and shows only the public half.

Every string field has a maximum length and a pattern; the pattern is applied
by Pydantic as a match of the whole value.  The per-warehouse checks that need
more than a pattern (the BigQuery key's contents, the Athena region list, the
Snowflake role list) run in the connection service.  Every model forbids
fields it does not list, so ``output_location``, ``external_id``, a password
or anything else unlisted is refused with 422.

The operator ceilings (``WAREHOUSE_MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``,
``WAREHOUSE_MAX_BYTES_PER_QUERY``, ``WAREHOUSE_MAX_RUNS_PER_DAY``) are checked
by the service, where the settings are read; the bounds here are the fixed
lower limits and an outer upper bound.
