# The modules' stacks (modules/infrastructure/cdk/stacks, issue #89)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The real-time counters table (P2-B), the analytics data lake (Kinesis +
# Firehose + OpenSearch) and the Glue ETL jobs (P3-A) belong to the counters
# and etl modules: their stacks live under modules/, which a core checkout
# does not have.
#
# Which profile this checkout deploys is decided the same way the application
# decides it (backend/app/modules_loader.py): by whether the modules are
# THERE.  A full checkout has modules/infrastructure/cdk/stacks and gets the
# three stacks; a core checkout has no modules/ and gets neither the stacks
# nor the API routes that would need them.  It was an environment variable
# (ENABLE_MODULE_STACKS) that nothing in the repository ever set, so
# `cdk deploy --all` on a full checkout silently produced no counters table
# and no Kinesis/OpenSearch/Glue while the API went on reporting `counters`
# and `etl` installed and the bandit scheduler retried DynamoDB every tick.
#
# EXPERIMENTLY_PROFILE -- the same variable the images and the API use --
# overrides the default in either direction: `core` deploys the core set from
# a full checkout, `full` insists on the module stacks and fails if they are
# absent rather than quietly dropping them.
#
# The stacks are loaded by file path so that `cdk synth` never imports the
# `modules` package (whose __init__ pulls in the backend application and its
# dependencies).
