class FargateServiceStack(Stack):
    """
    ECS Fargate service with blue/green CodeDeploy deployment.

    Provides:
    - ALB with HTTPS listener and HTTP->HTTPS redirect
    - Blue/green target groups for zero-downtime deployments
    - ECS Fargate service with CodeDeploy controller
    - Auto-scaling based on CPU and memory utilization
    - Secrets Manager integration for sensitive configuration

    Prerequisites:
    - An ACM certificate must exist for the HTTPS listener. Set the
      CERTIFICATE_ARN environment variable or pass certificate_arn to the
      constructor. Without it this stack refuses to build -- at ``cdk synth``,
      not at deploy, which is what this note used to say: both listeners are
      HTTPS and CDK validates that at the end of synthesis. A synth-only check
      may pass any well-formed ARN; nothing resolves it until a deployment.
    - The Secrets Manager secrets listed in docs/deployment/README.md must
      exist. ECS cannot start a task whose task definition names a secret that
      is not there, and the application cannot start without their values.
      The database credentials are NOT among them: they come from the secret
      the database stack generated for Aurora (``db_credentials``).

    ``db_host``, ``db_credentials`` and ``db_security_group`` are the database
    stack's writer endpoint, generated credentials secret and security group
    (#78). Synth refuses to build the stack without them; the security group is
    what this stack opens to the ECS tasks on 5432.

    ``redis_host`` and ``redis_port`` are the Redis stack's primary endpoint
    (#147). Synth refuses to build the stack without them: the application
    falls back to ``localhost`` and "degrades gracefully", so a missing host is
    an outage of rate limiting and caching that no probe reports.

    ``include_modules`` is the deployment's profile (``app.py`` passes
    ``ENABLE_MODULE_STACKS``). ``True`` adds the full profile's own secret,
    ``AUDIT_HMAC_KEY``; see the comment beside it.

        # rewrites the backend container's image to the one it just built (by
        # digest), registers that as a new revision and hands it to
        # CodeDeploy. CloudFormation never gets to choose: ECS
        # refuses a task-definition change on a service with a CODE_DEPLOY
        # controller outright -- "Unable to update task definition on services
        # with a CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller".
        #
        # So the tag below is a *bootstrap* image: the one thing that has to
        # exist before an environment can be stood up at all, because
        # CloudFormation cannot create an ECS service without a task
        # definition, and a task definition cannot name no image.
        #
        # It is deliberately not `latest`, and the reason is narrower than it
        # first looks -- this comment was rewritten after reading the ECS API
        # model rather than reasoning from the template.
        #
        # What is NOT true: that a `cdk deploy` can roll the running service
        # back. ECS refuses a task-definition change through `UpdateService`
        # on a CODE_DEPLOY service, and CodeDeploy deployments name a revision
        # ARN outright, so nothing here decides what serves traffic.
        #
        # What IS true: this revision is the one `Service.taskDefinition`
        # keeps pointing at forever. That field is "specified when the service
        # is created with CreateService, and it can be modified with
        # UpdateService" -- and UpdateService is the call just ruled out -- so
        # for the life of the service it names the revision CloudFormation
        # created, not the one serving traffic (that is
        # `taskSets[?status=='PRIMARY'].taskDefinition`). Anything that reads
        # the service to find "the current task definition" therefore lands
        # here.
        #
        # `:latest` made that a live image: the deploy workflow moved the tag
        # on every build (it no longer pushes it at all, #71), including builds that failed verification or were
        # rolled back, so the revision everyone mistakes for current pointed
        # at an arbitrary later build. A tag the pipeline never writes cannot
        # drift, so the mistake becomes visible instead of plausible.
        #

        # minutes, then the rest. Both 5xx alarms above, blue's and green's,
        # are in the group's AlarmConfiguration, which applies to the whole
        # deployment, not to a phase of it (the synth tests pin both). CDK's
        # documentation says the hour after the shift (termination_wait_time)
        # is monitored too; that, and what happens to an alarm already in
        # ALARM before the approval, is not yet observed in a real account.
        # While either is in ALARM, CodeDeploy stops the deployment
        # (STOP_ON_ALARM, from `deployment_in_alarm`) and rolls it back
        # (`stopped_deployment`). Nothing else judges the canary: a release
        # that answers wrongly with a 2xx, or with fewer errors than the alarm
        # needs, goes to 100%. The alarms need 2 of 3 one-minute periods plus
        # the metric delay, so a broken release is often caught after the
        # shift rather than in the 5 minutes.
