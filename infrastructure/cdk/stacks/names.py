"""Identifiers more than one tree has to agree on.

The ECR repository is the case that motivated this. The deployment guide told
operators to create `experimentation-backend` and `experimentation-migrations`
before the first deployment, and **nothing** used either name -- every
producer and consumer says `experimentation-platform/backend`. Following the
documentation exactly produced a first deploy that died at `docker push` with
"name unknown" (#211). The name was written down in five documents and two
stacks with nothing tying any of them together.

A name belongs here when more than one tree has to spell it the same way.
`infrastructure/tests/test_ecr_repository_agrees.py` asserts that the CDK, the
deploy workflow and every deployment document still agree about this one, so a
rename that misses a caller fails a test rather than a deployment.

The per-environment names below (#139, #142) are here because the stacks and
the deploy workflows both spell them. Every one carries the environment: two
environments in one account must never claim the same physical name, which
`infrastructure/tests/test_environments_do_not_collide.py` asserts over every
resource type the app synthesises.
