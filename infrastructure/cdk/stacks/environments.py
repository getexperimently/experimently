"""What differs between environments, decided in one place (#139, #142).

Two rules live here, and every stack asks this module rather than comparing
``env_name`` itself. Before this file each stack had its own spelling --
``RETAIN if env != "dev"`` in four places, ``SNAPSHOT`` everywhere in one,
``RETAIN`` unconditionally in six -- so a staging teardown left sixteen billed
or name-blocking resources behind and nobody had decided that it should.

**Retention.** ``prod`` keeps its data when a stack is destroyed; every other
environment (``dev``, ``staging``, ``demo``) is disposable and leaves nothing
behind. That is the whole rule: one environment's data is worth keeping, the
rest exist to be torn down and rebuilt, and a rebuilt staging must not collide
with the named resources its previous incarnation retained.

**Sizing.** ``prod`` gets the redundant shape (two NAT gateways, a writer and a
reader); every other environment gets one of each (DECISIONS D7 for the NAT
gateway, T24 for staging's single Aurora instance).

``infrastructure/tests/test_environments_do_not_collide.py`` asserts the
consequences on a real synth: the exact DeletionPolicy of every resource that
has one, per environment, and the exact instance and NAT gateway counts.
