"""The pipeline owns the image the API service runs; CDK only bootstraps it.

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds an image, rewrites the backend container
in the family's newest task definition to that image's DIGEST, registers that
as a new revision and hands the revision ARN to CodeDeploy.  CloudFormation is not
in that loop and cannot be: ECS refuses a task-definition change on a service
with a ``CODE_DEPLOY`` deployment controller ("Unable to update task definition
on services with a CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller").

What CloudFormation *can* still do is register a revision of its own.  The
service references the task definition **family**, and for a family with no
revision "the latest ACTIVE revision is used" -- so the newest revision is what
a forced new deployment, a CodeDeploy rollback or a task replacement would
run.  While the CDK's tag was ``latest`` that revision pointed at whatever the
deploy workflow had built most recently, including a build that failed
verification or was rolled back.

So the API service's tag must be one the pipeline never writes (#82).  The
migration task used to be the exception, on purpose: the deploy pushed
``:latest`` and ran the family by name, so ``latest`` meant "the image being
deployed" -- until another environment or profile built after it, since one
ECR repository serves them all and ECS resolves a tag at every task start
(#71, #138).  Now the deploy registers a migration revision naming the image by
DIGEST and runs that ARN, nothing pushes ``:latest``, and NO task definition
the app synthesises may name it.
