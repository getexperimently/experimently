"""`infrastructure/cdk/app.py` — which stacks each profile builds.

The three module stacks (the real-time counters table, the analytics data lake
and the Glue ETL jobs) were gated on ``ENABLE_MODULE_STACKS``, a variable
nothing in the repository ever set.  ``cdk deploy --all`` from a full checkout
therefore built none of them, while the API went on reporting ``counters`` and
``etl`` installed, the bandit scheduler retried DynamoDB every tick, and the
core monitoring stack kept an alarm on a Kinesis stream nothing had created.

The gate is now the presence of ``modules/infrastructure/cdk/stacks`` — the
same rule ``backend/app/modules_loader.py`` applies to the application — with
``EXPERIMENTLY_PROFILE`` as the explicit override.

``app.py`` is run the way ``cdk synth`` runs it, with ``App.synth`` stubbed out
so the assertions below are about which stacks the app *contains*.

That stub is also why a two-year-old defect shipped.  ``app.synth()`` raised
``DependencyCycle`` between ``experimentation-compute-dev`` and
``experimentation-fargate-dev`` from the day EP-019 added the Fargate stack,
and every test here passed throughout, because none of them ever called it: a
dependency cycle is an app-level, synth-time failure, invisible to
``Template.from_stack`` on one stack at a time.  ``TestTheAppActuallySynthesises``
at the bottom of this file is the test that would have caught it, and is the
regression test for the fix.
