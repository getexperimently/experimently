"""docs/deployment/disaster-recovery.md states what the CDK app actually creates (#168).

The page used to promise S3 cross-region replication of "frontend" assets
(no stack puts the dashboard in S3), replicated secrets, a 35-day Aurora
retention (true only since #391 set it), log export to S3 and alarms that do
not exist. Operators follow that page mid-incident, so each figure it now
gives is checked here against a real ``app.synth()`` of prod (and of staging,
for the Aurora retention), and the page must still say it. A change to the
stacks that moves one of them fails here until the page is updated with it.
