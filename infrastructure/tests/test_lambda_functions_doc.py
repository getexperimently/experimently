"""The docs say which Lambda functions the CDK deploys, and that none serves requests (#125).

`security/threat-model.md`, `integrations/aws.md` and
`getting-started/architecture.md` described working assignment,
event-processor and flag-evaluation Lambdas. The stacks deploy two
placeholders whose inline code returns 200 and the Glue ETL trigger; the code
under backend/lambda/ is deployed by nothing. This synthesises prod (full
profile) and checks that list, and that the pages still say so. Deploying a
real function fails here until the pages describe it.
