/**
 * The docs hub (`/docs`) makes no claim the repository does not back (T86).
 *
 * Each entry is a claim the hub used to make: an SDK count `sdk/` had
 * outgrown, a latency nobody measured, local hashing the SDKs do not do (the
 * server decides), a one-step deploy that takes several, a search box that was
 * a folder listing, and the AWS name as a hyphenated adjective.
 *
 * The fragments are concatenated, not joined with whitespace, so each entry is
 * exactly the regular expression it reads as once put together; they are split
 * only so the old wording never appears in this file. A bare `\b14\b` is
 * deliberately absent: it matches the hub's correct "iOS 14+".
 *
 * Matched against `container.textContent`, so a claim split across nested
 * elements is still seen. The `<Head>` description is not in it; the
 * marketing build grep covers that.
