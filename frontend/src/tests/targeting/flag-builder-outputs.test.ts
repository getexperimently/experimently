/**
 * Everything the flag pages' rule builder can send is accepted, stopped in
 * the browser, or refused by the server and shown beside the rules with the
 * place it names (#535 V8, the browser half).
 *
 * `fixtures/flag-builder-outputs.json` records, for every row of
 * `flagBuilderGrid()`, what the page sends and which of the three happens.
 * This file checks the record against the page's own code: the rows are the
 * grid's rows, each `sends` is what the page would send, and a row is
 * `blocked_in_browser` exactly when the page's pre-save check stops it. The
 * server half, `backend/tests/unit/core/test_flag_builder_outputs.py`, checks
 * `accepted` and `refused_by_server` (with the path and reason) against the
 * API's targeting validator. Both read the same file, so they cannot drift.
 *
 * The counts are pinned: a new attribute, operator or value moves them, and
 * the fixture is regenerated and both halves re-run.
