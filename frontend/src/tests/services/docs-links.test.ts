/**
 * Guard: every `docsUrl('...')` literal in the dashboard must address a file
 * that exists under `docs/`.
 *
 * Why this exists. The docs links were dead — all of them. `docsUrl()`
 * defaulted to the MkDocs site, which `.github/workflows/docs.yml` publishes
 * only on a release tag from the public repository; there are no tags and the
 * repository is private, so the site had never been built and every link
 * answered 404. Nothing noticed, because nothing checked either half: not that
 * the destination exists, and not that the page does.
 *
 * This is the second half — the page. It is the same shape as
 * `url-literals.test.ts`, which checks `/api/v1/` literals against the OpenAPI
 * dump: scan the sources, resolve each literal, assert the target is real.
 *
 * It cannot check that the SITE is reachable (no network in a unit test, and
 * the answer depends on repository visibility). What it does check is that a
 * link never points at a page that does not exist — which is the failure this
 * codebase can actually introduce, by renaming or deleting a doc.
