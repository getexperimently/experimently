 * The privacy notice for the website at getexperimently.com.

 * described here.
 *
 * Every statement below was checked against the marketing build when it was
 * written: the frontend loads no analytics or tracking script, sets no cookie,
 * and the pages the marketing build ships write nothing to browser storage
 * (the only `localStorage` write is the dashboard's sign-in token, and the
 * marketing build has no sign-in). If any of that changes, change this page in
 * the same pull request.

            This page covers the website at getexperimently.com. It does not cover a copy of
            Experimently that you run yourself; that runs on your own infrastructure and its data
            stays with you.

            This site sets no cookies and runs no analytics or tracking scripts. It does not store
            anything in your browser, and it has no accounts or forms. The power calculator works
            out its results in your browser; the numbers you enter are not sent to us.

          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Like any website, this one is served by a hosting provider, which keeps standard access
            logs of the requests it serves. These typically include your IP address, the time of
            the request, the page requested and the browser&apos;s user-agent string. We use them
            only to keep the site running.
