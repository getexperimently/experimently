/**
 * Which site is this build?
 *
 * One codebase serves two things:
 *
 *   platform   what a self-hoster runs. The dashboard, behind authentication,
 *              against their own API. This is the default, because it is the
 *              product.
 *   marketing  the public site at getexperimently.com. Static, no API behind
 *              it, and there is no hosted tier -- the homepage says so.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The marketing build shipped the whole dashboard:
 * `/experiments`, `/feature-flags`, `/admin/*`, `/results`, `/workspaces`, and
 * three "Sign in" buttons. None of it can work there -- `POST
 * /api/v1/auth/login` returns the site's own HTML with a 404 -- so a visitor
 * evaluating the project met a login form that silently fails. A dead sign-in
 * button is worse than no sign-in button: it reads as a broken product rather
 * than as software you run yourself.
 *
 * Set at BUILD time, like every `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`. Anything reading this must
 * tolerate both values at runtime; nothing may assume the marketing build is
 * the only static one.
