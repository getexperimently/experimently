/**
 * Where a "read the guide" link goes.
 *
 * The docs are markdown under `docs/` at the repository root. The dashboard
 * used to render that markdown itself, from a slug map with no test, inside
 * the authenticated bundle — every page read "coming soon" when it was not.
 * Now the dashboard links out, and `docsUrl()` is the single place that
 * decides where "out" is.
 *
 * DEFAULT: THE REPOSITORY, NOT THE MKDOCS SITE. The published site
 * (`mkdocs.yml` `site_url`, `MKDOCS_SITE_URL` below) is built and deployed by
 * `.github/workflows/docs.yml` from release tags only, so it follows the
 * latest release rather than `main`. A dashboard someone runs themselves may
 * be any version, and the repository's markdown is the copy that cannot be
 * missing: GitHub renders it, with no dependency on the release pipeline. So
 * the default is a GitHub blob URL. (The default once was the site, before it
 * had ever been deployed, and every link -- the homepage's primary button
 * among them -- answered 404. `docs.test.ts` pins that it is not again.)
 *
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL` overrides that with the origin of a *built* site, and
 * the URLs then take MkDocs's `use_directory_urls` shape instead. The
 * marketing build (`npm run build:marketing`) sets it to the published site,
 * which is where getexperimently.com's links go; anyone serving their own
 * `mkdocs build` output can set it to that. Read at build time, like every
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.
 *
 * `url-literals.test.ts` does this for `/api/v1/` paths; `docs-links.test.ts`
 * does it here — every `docsUrl('...')` literal in the dashboard must resolve
 * to a file that exists under `docs/`. Its Python twin,
 * `backend/tests/unit/docs/test_dashboard_docs_links.py`, applies the same rule
 * on a docs-only pull request and pins itself to the Jest file's text.
