/**
 * Playwright configuration for the Experimently dashboard.
 *
 * Three projects:
 *   - `journeys` — the five fail-hard PR journeys (`*.journey.spec.ts`), the
 *     required `browser-e2e` gate. Run them with `--project=journeys`.
 *   - `sso` — sign in with SSO from the dashboard (`*.sso.spec.ts`, C2b). It
 *     needs its own API process and the fake OIDC provider, which the
 *     `browser-e2e` job starts as steps; see tests/e2e/sso-sign-in.sso.spec.ts.
 *   - `extended` — everything else under tests/e2e (accessibility, visual
 *     regression); nightly territory, not a PR gate.
 *
 * The web server is chosen automatically so nobody has to remember a flag:
 *   - a dashboard already answering on the base URL is reused (local dev);
 *   - otherwise, if `frontend/out` holds a static export (CI, after
 *     `npm run build`), it is served by tests/e2e/static-server.mjs exactly the
 *     way nginx serves it in the image — including the `/api` proxy, so the
 *     dashboard and the API share one origin and the browser sends no CORS
 *     preflight (build that export with NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="");
 *   - otherwise `npm run dev` is started.
 *
 * Environment variables:
 *   PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL    dashboard origin        (default http://localhost:3100)
 *   PLAYWRIGHT_API_URL     backend origin          (default http://localhost:8000)
 *   PLAYWRIGHT_PORT        port for the managed server (default 3100)
 *   PLAYWRIGHT_WEB_SERVER  auto | dev | export | none   (default auto)
 *   PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS    "false" to watch the browser
