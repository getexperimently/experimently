# IAM permissions for deploying

Three identities touch an AWS account that runs Experimently, and they need
different things. Keep them separate: the one that deploys releases every week
should not be able to rewrite the account.

| Identity | Who uses it | When | What it needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bootstrap** | a human, once per account and region | `cdk bootstrap` | create the CDK toolkit stack (below) |
| **`cdk deploy`** | a human standing up or changing an environment | `ENVIRONMENT=<env> cdk deploy …` | `sts:AssumeRole` on the bootstrap's `cdk-*` roles, and a few one-off extras |
| **Workflow role** | GitHub Actions, through OIDC | Deploy, Rollback, Database Migration | exactly the generated list below |

Nothing in this repository creates any of them. They are set up by a person
with IAM rights in the account, before the first deploy
([deployment guide, section 1](deployment-guide.md#1-before-the-first-deploy)).

## 1. The bootstrap identity

`cdk bootstrap aws://<account>/<region>` creates the `CDKToolkit`
CloudFormation stack: an S3 bucket and an ECR repository for assets, SSM
parameter `/cdk-bootstrap/hnb659fds/version`, and the IAM roles
`cdk-hnb659fds-{deploy,cfn-exec,file-publishing,image-publishing,lookup}-role-<account>-<region>`.
So it needs to create CloudFormation stacks, IAM roles and policies, an S3
bucket, an ECR repository and an SSM parameter. In practice that is an
administrator, once. Nothing afterwards should use it.

## 2. The `cdk deploy` identity

With a modern bootstrap, `cdk deploy` does not use its caller's permissions to
create resources: it assumes the bootstrap roles, and CloudFormation acts as
`cdk-hnb659fds-cfn-exec-role-…`. The caller needs:

- `sts:AssumeRole` on `arn:aws:iam::<account>:role/cdk-hnb659fds-*`;
- for the one-off steps the deployment guide has them do by hand:
  `ecr:CreateRepository` and push rights on `experimentation-platform/backend`
  and `experimentation-platform/web`, `secretsmanager:CreateSecret` on
  `/<env>/experimentation/*`, and `acm:RequestCertificate` /
  `acm:DescribeCertificate` (plus `route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets` if DNS is
  in Route 53).

Check it before relying on it:

```bash
aws iam simulate-principal-policy \
  --policy-source-arn <the identity's ARN> \
  --action-names sts:AssumeRole \
  --resource-arns "arn:aws:iam::<account>:role/cdk-hnb659fds-deploy-role-<account>-<region>"
```

## 3. The workflow role (GitHub OIDC)

One role **per environment**, each trusted only by jobs bound to that GitHub
environment, and each holding the same permissions policy.

### Trust policy

[`infrastructure/cdk/github-actions-trust-policy.json`](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/blob/main/infrastructure/cdk/github-actions-trust-policy.json)
is the template. Replace `<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>` and `<ENVIRONMENT>` (`staging` or
`prod`) and create one role from each copy. It pins the token's `sub` claim
exactly -- `StringEquals`, no wildcard:

```
repo:getexperimently@328439352/experimently@1367480368:environment:<ENVIRONMENT>
```

That is GitHub's **immutable subject**: the owner and repository by name *and*
numeric id, so a repository deleted and recreated under the same name (or a
transferred one) cannot assume the role. This repository uses it; the prefix
comes from

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/oidc/customization/sub
```

It prints:

```text
{"use_default":true,"use_immutable_subject":true,
 "sub_claim_prefix":"repo:getexperimently@328439352/experimently@1367480368"}
```

and a fork or a copy of this repository has a different one: read yours with
the same call. The `:environment:<name>` suffix is what a job that declares
`environment:` receives, which is the only kind of job in these workflows that
assumes the role.

**Before writing the policy, decode a real token.** The prefix above was read
from the API, not from a token. Before the first staging deploy, run a
throwaway job bound to the `staging` environment that prints only the
*payload* of its OIDC token's `sub` claim, and the trust policy is written
from what it printed. The **OIDC subject probe** workflow
(`.github/workflows/oidc-sub-probe.yml`; Actions → OIDC subject probe → Run
workflow, from `main`) is that job: it prints `sub`, `aud` and `environment`
and never the token. Protect the environment first (see
[GitHub side](#github-side)). A `sub` that does not match fails `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`
with "Not authorized", which is the safe direction.

The account also needs the GitHub OIDC provider
(`token.actions.githubusercontent.com`, audience `sts.amazonaws.com`), once.

### Session length

Each environment role needs a **`MaxSessionDuration` of 10800 seconds (3
hours)**. The workflows ask for a session as long as the job may run:
`role-duration-seconds` is 9000 in `deploy.yml` (a 150-minute job) and 5400 in
`db-migrate.yml` and `rollback.yml` (90-minute jobs). IAM's default maximum is
one hour, and a request above the role's maximum fails at the "Configure AWS
credentials" step, before anything has changed.

Create the role with `--max-session-duration 10800`. For a role that already
exists:

```bash
aws iam update-role --role-name <ROLE_NAME> --max-session-duration 10800
```

### Permissions policy

[`infrastructure/cdk/github-actions-deploy-policy.json`](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/blob/main/infrastructure/cdk/github-actions-deploy-policy.json),
generated -- like the table below -- by `scripts/iam_actions.py` from every
`aws <service> <verb>` in `deploy.yml`, `rollback.yml`, `db-migrate.yml`, the
local actions under `.github/actions/`, the scripts those run, and any script
listed in `STAGED_SCRIPTS` there (one the role will run that no workflow names
yet, so the policy can be re-applied before the deploy that needs it). A unit test
fails when a workflow gains a call the committed copies do not grant, so the
list cannot fall behind the workflows. `iam:PassRole` is granted only for
passing roles to ECS tasks.

Resources are `*`, except `rds:AddTagsToResource`, which is granted only on
cluster snapshots (below). Narrowing them to one environment's ARNs is worth doing;
it is not done here, because the names mix generated identifiers (the Aurora
cluster, the task roles) that are only known after `cdk deploy`.

`ecs:UpdateService` is on `*` too, and that is a deliberate choice, not an
oversight. It is there for `scripts/ecs_rolling_rollout.sh`, which rolls the
dashboard service out to a new revision, but the action can also change any
service's desired count, load balancers and deployment controller, the API's
included. It adds no reach the role lacks: the role already holds
`ecs:RunTask`, `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition` and `iam:PassRole` to ECS tasks on
`*`, which together run any image with any task role in the account, so that
grant dominates it. Each environment is its own AWS account (D7), so the account
is the boundary, not the resource list.

Six of the actions are not visible in the workflow text and come from AWS's
documentation of what the call needs: `iam:PassRole` (registering and running
a task definition that names roles), `codedeploy:GetDeploymentConfig` /
`codedeploy:RegisterApplicationRevision` / `codedeploy:GetApplicationRevision`
(creating a deployment from an AppSpec, below),
`rds:AddTagsToResource` (a cluster snapshot that copies the cluster's tags,
below), and `codedeploy:UpdateDeploymentGroup` (creating one with
`--override-alarm-configuration`, below). The first five are the `IMPLIED`
table in `scripts/iam_actions.py`, each entry citing the AWS page it comes
from; a command's other conditional requirements, and why each does not
apply here, are listed beside it. Confirm the whole list with
`aws iam simulate-principal-policy` before the first staging deploy.

`codedeploy:UpdateDeploymentGroup` is there because of a flag, not a verb
(#148). The API's deployment group has two 5xx alarms, and CodeDeploy stops
every deployment to the group while one of them is in ALARM. The release
being rolled back is usually what holds it there, so Rollback creates its
deployment with `--override-alarm-configuration enabled=false`, always, and
Deploy does the same only under its break-glass input
([Fix forward while an alarm is firing](rollback-runbook.md#fix-forward-while-an-alarm-is-firing)).
AWS documents that overriding alarms on `CreateDeployment` needs the
`UpdateDeploymentGroup` permission; there is no narrower action. It is a real
widening: with it the role could also change the group itself, for example
remove its alarms, which the next `cdk deploy` would put back. What it adds is
small: the role can already create a deployment of any AppSpec, and it cannot
change the group's service role, because `iam:PassRole` is granted only to ECS
tasks. The only narrowing available is the resource, the environment's
deployment-group ARN; like everything here it is `*`. Whether AWS accepts the
override without it is not yet checked in a real account; the expected result
is `AccessDenied` on the create-deployment.

**A role created before an update to this policy must have it re-applied.** The
policy is applied by hand, so a role keeps whatever it was given. The
forward-deploy traffic shift (#143) added four read actions:
`cloudformation:DescribeStackResources`, `elasticloadbalancing:DescribeListeners`,
`elasticloadbalancing:DescribeRules` and `elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetHealth`.
A role without them fails the deploy red at the traffic shift. The run stops
with "Could not tell whether the API is serving" (`AccessDenied` on
`describe-target-health` once the deployment is `Ready`), and it never approves
the shift. Nothing shifts, and CodeDeploy stops the unapproved deployment when
its 30-minute approval wait ends. Re-apply
`infrastructure/cdk/github-actions-deploy-policy.json` to every environment's
role before its next deploy.

The dashboard rollout (#69) adds `ecs:UpdateService` and `ecs:ListTasks`: Deploy
and Rollback both run `scripts/ecs_rolling_rollout.sh`, which points the
dashboard's service at a new revision and, when a rollout fails, lists its
stopped tasks.
Roles created from a policy before the dashboard rollout lack `ecs:UpdateService`
and `ecs:ListTasks`; re-apply this policy in every account before the first
deploy of a release that includes the dashboard rollout. A role
without them stops at the dashboard's `update-service` with "ecs:UpdateService
was denied", after the API has already shifted, and Deploy then refuses a re-run
until that CodeDeploy deployment is no longer active (about an hour).

The API's alarms (#148) add `codedeploy:UpdateDeploymentGroup` and a
`codedeploy:GetDeployment` read in Deploy. Roles created from a policy before
the alarms lack `codedeploy:UpdateDeploymentGroup`; re-apply this policy in
every account before the first `cdk deploy` that adds the alarms. The failure
without it is the dangerous kind: Rollback's `create-deployment` is refused
with `AccessDenied` in the middle of an incident, and so is a Deploy with the
alarm override. The deployment group's own read of its alarms
(`cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms`) is on CodeDeploy's service role, which the CDK
creates; the workflow role's grant of the same action, below, is a separate
one.

Deploy's alarm pre-flight (#297, `scripts/refuse_alarm_active.py`) adds two
reads: `codedeploy:GetDeploymentGroup`, for the alarm names the group polls,
and `cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms`, for their states. Roles created from a policy
before the pre-flight lack `codedeploy:GetDeploymentGroup` and
`cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms`; re-apply this policy in every account before the
first deploy of a release that includes the pre-flight. The failure without
them is loud and safe: every deploy stops at "Could not read the API's
alarms", before anything is built, snapshotted or migrated.

The pre-migration snapshot (#744) adds `rds:AddTagsToResource`, which no
command names: the CDK's Aurora cluster copies its tags to each snapshot, and
AWS authorizes that copy as a tagging call on the new snapshot.
`scripts/iam_actions.py` grants it from its `IMPLIED` table, only on cluster
snapshots (`arn:aws:rds:*:*:cluster-snapshot:*`). Roles created from a policy
before #744 lack `rds:AddTagsToResource`; re-apply this policy in every
account before the next deploy. The failure without it is loud and safe:
Deploy's "Snapshot the database before migrating" step (and Database
Migration's "Take a snapshot first") stops with "not authorized to perform:
rds:AddTagsToResource on resource: arn:aws:rds:...:cluster-snapshot:...",
and nothing is snapshotted, migrated or shifted. This is how the first
staging deploy stopped.

`codedeploy:GetApplicationRevision` (#754) was added after the staging
rollback rehearsal. AWS's CodeDeploy guide asks for it *or*
`codedeploy:RegisterApplicationRevision` alongside `CreateDeployment`, and
only the second was granted. Deploy's `create-deployment`, with an AppSpec for
a new revision, passed. Rollback's, with an AppSpec for a revision deployed
before (the previous task definition), was refused for
`codedeploy:GetApplicationRevision`. Both are now granted. Roles created from a
policy before #754 lack it; re-apply this policy in every account before the
next rollback. The failure without it comes after the in-flight deployment has
been stopped: Rollback's "Roll back via CodeDeploy" step stops with "not
authorized to perform: codedeploy:GetApplicationRevision", and no rollback
deployment is created.

### GitHub side

Per environment (`staging`, `prod`): Settings → Environments → *env*:

- **required reviewer**, and **deployment branches: `main` only** -- set these
  first, before any variable or secret (a dispatch that names an environment
  that does not exist creates it, unprotected);
- secret `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` -- that environment's account, 12 digits
  (`gh secret set AWS_ACCOUNT_ID --env <env>`). A secret, not a variable: the
  workflow logs are public, and a step's log header prints a variable's value
  before anything can mask it. An `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` *variable* is not read;
  move it to a secret, then `gh variable delete AWS_ACCOUNT_ID --env <env>`;
- secret `AWS_ROLE_ARN` -- that environment's role
  (`gh secret set AWS_ROLE_ARN --env <env>`);
- variable `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` -- the origin the stacks were deployed with
  (`gh variable set PUBLIC_BASE_URL --env <env> --body https://app.<domain>`).

`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` may be a repository secret; it is optional.
