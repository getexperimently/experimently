- **EP-019:** Production Deployment & Operations (3 days)
- **EP-020:** Data Export & Reporting Features (3 days)

**Total Additional:** 16 days (~3 weeks)

### Option 2: Extend Existing Tickets
Add missing items to existing tickets:
- Add GAP #1 (Override Management) to **EP-010**
- Add GAP #3 (Results Viz) to **EP-003**
- Add GAP #4 (Dashboards) to **EP-003**
- Add GAP #6 (Export) to **EP-014**
- Add GAP #8 (Samples) to **EP-014**
- Add GAP #9 (Auto-scaling) to **EP-012**
- Add GAP #10 (Security) to **EP-012**
- Add GAP #11 (Browser testing) to **EP-011**
- Add GAP #12 (Deployment) to **EP-014**

**Impact:** Increases story points on existing tickets by ~20 points

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- Create critical production tickets (EP-018, EP-019)
- Extend existing tickets with related features
- Defer nice-to-have items to post-MVP

---

## 📊 Revised Estimates

### Current Tickets: 68 points (~16 weeks)
### Critical Gaps: +16 points (~3 weeks)
### **Total with Gaps: 84 points (~19 weeks)**

### With Parallel Work:
- Backend: 13 weeks
- Frontend: 12 weeks
- QA/Testing: 8 weeks
- DevOps: 6 weeks

**Realistic Timeline: 12-16 weeks** (original plan was 12 weeks)

---

## ✅ Conclusion

**The created tickets capture ~75% of the MVP scope effectively**, with most critical backend and testing infrastructure covered.

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Lambda implementations (EP-010) are comprehensive
- ✅ Testing framework (EP-011, EP-012) is well-specified
- ✅ Monitoring (EP-013) covers operational needs
- ✅ Documentation (EP-014) addresses knowledge gaps

**Key Gaps:**
- ❌ Some frontend analytics/dashboards missing
- ❌ Production deployment procedures need formalization
- ❌ Security audit not explicitly covered
- ❌ Some Priority 2 features (export, samples) missing

**Recommendation:** Create 3-4 additional tickets for critical gaps (#10, #12, #3, and optionally #20 for exports), which adds ~3 weeks to the timeline but ensures production readiness.
