## Using the SQLAlchemy Models

### Basic Usage

Here's how to use the models in your application code:

```python
from backend.app.db.session import SessionLocal
from backend.app.models.experiment import Experiment, ExperimentStatus, Variant

# Create a database session
db = SessionLocal()

try:
    # Query experiments
    active_experiments = db.query(Experiment).filter(
        Experiment.status == ExperimentStatus.ACTIVE
    ).all()
    
    # Create a new experiment
    new_experiment = Experiment(
        name="Homepage Button Color Test",
        description="Testing different button colors on the homepage",
        hypothesis="A green button will have a higher click-through rate than a blue button",
        status=ExperimentStatus.DRAFT,
        owner_id=user_id
    )
    db.add(new_experiment)
    
    # Add variants to the experiment
    control_variant = Variant(
        experiment_id=new_experiment.id,
        name="Control (Blue)",
        description="The current blue button",
        is_control=True,
        traffic_allocation=50,
        configuration={"color": "blue", "hex": "#0066CC"}
    )
    
    treatment_variant = Variant(
        experiment_id=new_experiment.id,
        name="Treatment (Green)",
        description="The new green button",
        is_control=False,
        traffic_allocation=50,
        configuration={"color": "green", "hex": "#00CC66"}
    )
    
    db.add_all([control_variant, treatment_variant])
    db.commit()
    
except Exception as e:
    db.rollback()
    raise e
finally:
    db.close()
```

### With FastAPI Dependency Injection

In a FastAPI application, you can use dependency injection:

```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

from backend.app.api.deps import get_db
from backend.app.models.experiment import Experiment

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/experiments/{experiment_id}")
def get_experiment(experiment_id: str, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    experiment = db.query(Experiment).filter(Experiment.id == experiment_id).first()
    if not experiment:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Experiment not found")
    return experiment.to_dict()
```

## Database Migrations with Alembic

### Before You Start

Run every command in this section from the repository root, in the development
virtual environment that
[Python Virtual Environment Setup](../../getting-started/python-virtual-env-setup.md)
makes:

```{.bash exec}
source venv/bin/activate
```

Alembic connects with the `POSTGRES_*` settings. Their defaults (`localhost:5432`,
user and password `postgres`, database `experimentation`, schema
`experimentation`) are the PostgreSQL that `make db` starts, which is also the
[Quick Start](../../getting-started/quick-start.md) stack's. Set them only for
another server. CI runs this section as written against the Quick Start stack.

### A New Database

A new database gets its schema from the bootstrap, never from the migrations:
the historical chain cannot be replayed from an empty database. Do not
autogenerate an "initial migration" for one either. Against an empty database
`--autogenerate` writes a revision that creates every table again, beside the
chain that already does. The bootstrap creates the schema from the models and
records the heads. On a database that already has tables it runs `upgrade heads`
instead, so it is safe to run again:

```{.bash exec}
ENVIRONMENT=development python -m backend.app.db.bootstrap
```
<!-- expect: Database bootstrap complete -->

It ends with `Database bootstrap complete (created)` on a new database and
`Database bootstrap complete (upgraded)` on one that had tables.
`ENVIRONMENT=development` lets it create the first administrator with the
development default password (`FIRST_SUPERUSER`, `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`) when
the database has no users.

The Quick Start stack runs the core images, so the database it makes has the
core chain only. A full checkout's bootstrap against it also applies the
`modules` branch and creates the module tables, and logs a WARNING saying so
(see [Switching Profile](../../self-hosting/migrations.md#switching-profile)).

A full checkout has two heads, the core chain and the `modules` branch, and
`heads` labels the second:

```{.bash exec}
alembic -c backend/app/db/alembic.ini heads
```
<!-- expect: (modules) (head) -->

The database records one row per head:

```{.bash exec}
alembic -c backend/app/db/alembic.ini current
```
<!-- expect: (head) -->

### Creating New Migrations

Whenever you make changes to the models, generate a new migration script. Name
the head the revision extends: the core head is the line of `heads` without
`(modules)`, and a module's change extends `modules@head`. The file lands next to
that head. Without `--head`, alembic refuses with "Multiple heads are present".
Never answer that with `alembic merge`: the merge file lands in the core chain
with the module head in its `down_revision`, and a core checkout then cannot
load its migrations at all.

```{.bash skip reason="fragment: <core head id> is the core line that alembic heads prints"}
alembic -c backend/app/db/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate \
        --head <core head id> -m "Description of changes"
```

Autogenerate compares the models with the database, so run it against a database
at the heads. Its file is a starting point, not a finished migration. Open and
review it before applying it:

```python
# Example generated migration
def upgrade() -> None:
    op.add_column(
        'users',
        sa.Column('email_verified', sa.Boolean(), nullable=True),
        schema='experimentation'
    )

def downgrade() -> None:
    op.drop_column('users', 'email_verified', schema='experimentation')
```

Check for:

- a `down_revision` that is the revision ID of the head it extends;
- the schema name (`schema='experimentation'`) on every operation;
- no table dropped, and no data lost, that you did not mean;
- the data types and constraints you meant.

Apply the migration:

```{.bash exec}
python -m alembic -c backend/app/db/alembic.ini upgrade heads
```

`alembic revision` runs `backend/app/db/migrations/env.py` here (`revision_environment = true`
in `alembic.ini`), so it needs the same database connection `--autogenerate`
does. A core checkout has one head and needs no `--head`.

### Migration Commands Reference

Upgrade to the latest version:

```{.bash exec}
python -m alembic -c backend/app/db/alembic.ini upgrade heads
```

Downgrade the previous revision of one branch. With two heads a bare `downgrade -1` is ambiguous -- alembic warns and picks one -- so name the branch: `modules@-1` for a module's, the revision id for a core one. NOT `modules@base`: modules_0001_rbac is a child of core a7b8c9d0e1f2, not an alembic base, and `modules@base` resolves to the whole core chain, every table dropped:

```{.bash skip reason="destructive: unapplies the newest modules revision and drops the tables it created"}
alembic -c backend/app/db/alembic.ini downgrade modules@-1
```

Downgrade to a specific version:

```{.bash skip reason="fragment: <revision> is a revision id from alembic history"}
alembic -c backend/app/db/alembic.ini downgrade <revision>
```

Show current version (one row per head):

```{.bash exec}
alembic -c backend/app/db/alembic.ini current
```
<!-- expect: (head) -->

Show migration history, newest first, down to the first revision (`<base> -> ...`):

```{.bash exec}
alembic -c backend/app/db/alembic.ini history
```
<!-- expect: (modules) (head) -->
<!-- expect: <base> -->

The modules branch has two revisions, `modules_0001_rbac` and then
`modules_0002_warehouse_analysis`: `downgrade modules@-1` unapplies
`modules_0002_warehouse_analysis` only, and `downgrade modules@-2` the whole
branch.

## Working with Experiments

### Creating an Experiment

```python
from backend.app.models.experiment import Experiment, ExperimentStatus, ExperimentType, Variant
from uuid import UUID

def create_experiment(db, name, description, hypothesis, owner_id, variants_data):
    """
    Create a new experiment with variants.
    
    Args:
        db: SQLAlchemy session
        name: Experiment name
        description: Experiment description
        hypothesis: Experiment hypothesis
        owner_id: User ID of experiment owner
        variants_data: List of variant configurations
    
    Returns:
        Created experiment object
    """
    # Create experiment
    experiment = Experiment(
        name=name,
        description=description,
        hypothesis=hypothesis,
        status=ExperimentStatus.DRAFT,
        experiment_type=ExperimentType.A_B,
        owner_id=UUID(owner_id) if isinstance(owner_id, str) else owner_id
    )
    db.add(experiment)
    db.flush()  # Flush to get the experiment ID
    
    # Create variants
    variants = []
    for variant_data in variants_data:
        variant = Variant(
            experiment_id=experiment.id,
            name=variant_data["name"],
            description=variant_data.get("description", ""),
            is_control=variant_data.get("is_control", False),
            traffic_allocation=variant_data.get("traffic_allocation", 50),
            configuration=variant_data.get("configuration", {})
        )
        variants.append(variant)
    
    db.add_all(variants)

    return experiment
```
