# Team Workspaces — Overview

!!! info "Part of the `workspaces` module"
    Team workspaces is one of the optional modules -- present in the **full profile**, absent from the core one. A core deployment does not serve these routes. See [Modules and profiles](../getting-started/modules.md) for what each profile includes and how to run the full one.

## What Are Workspaces?

A **workspace** groups platform users into a team, with a workspace role for
each member. It represents a team, project, or product area — for example:

- `acme-mobile` for the mobile engineering team
- `acme-web` for the web product team
- `acme-growth` for the growth squad

A workspace holds its members, their workspace roles and its pending
invitations. The workspace routes (`/api/v1/workspaces/...`) check membership
and workspace role: only a member can read a workspace or its member list, and
only an ADMIN or OWNER of that workspace can change its settings, members or
invites (any member can leave).

### What workspaces do not do

Workspaces do **not** decide which experiments, feature flags or API keys a
user can see or change. Experiments and feature flags are not created inside a
workspace, and workspace membership plays no part when they are listed, read
or changed. That is decided by the user's **platform role** (ADMIN, DEVELOPER,
ANALYST or VIEWER) across the whole installation — see [Role-based access
control](../rbac/README.md). Joining or leaving a workspace does not change
which experiments and flags a user can see or change.

If you need teams to be unable to see each other's experiments and flags, run a
separate installation for each team.

## Role Hierarchy

Every workspace member has exactly one workspace role. The roles form a
hierarchy, and a workspace role applies only to the workspace routes:

| Role          | On the workspace routes |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| **OWNER**     | Everything an ADMIN can do, and delete the workspace |
| **ADMIN**     | Update workspace settings, add and remove members, change member roles, send invites |
| **DEVELOPER** | Read the workspace and its member list; leave the workspace |
| **ANALYST**   | Read the workspace and its member list; leave the workspace |
| **VIEWER**    | Read the workspace and its member list; leave the workspace |

DEVELOPER, ANALYST and VIEWER are recorded for each member but currently grant
the same thing on the workspace routes. None of the five changes what the member
can do with experiments, feature flags or platform API keys; the platform role
does that.

### Changing Roles

- An ADMIN or OWNER can change a member's role among VIEWER, ANALYST,
  DEVELOPER and ADMIN. The last remaining OWNER cannot be demoted or removed.
- A member can remove themselves; an OWNER can do so only while there is at
  least one other OWNER.

## Plans and Limits

Workspaces have no plan and no limits: a workspace can have any number of
members. A create or update request that sends `plan` is refused with `422`.

---

## API Keys

Workspaces do not issue API keys. To connect an SDK, send events or evaluate
flags, use a **platform API key**. A superuser can create one in the dashboard
under **Admin → API Keys**. Any signed-in user can create one for themselves
with `POST /api/v1/api-keys`; step 3 of the [quickstart](./quickstart.md)
links to the full guide. A key acts as the user who created it.

## Invitations

Workspace members can be added in two ways:

1. **Direct add** (ADMIN+): Look up an existing platform user by their UUID and
   add them immediately with the desired role.
2. **Email invite** (ADMIN+): Create an invite for an email address. No email
   is sent. The dashboard shows the invitation link after you create it, with
   a **Copy link** button; the API response contains the token (the link is
   `/workspaces/invites/<token>` on the dashboard's address). Send the link to
   the recipient. The token is valid for 7 days. When the recipient accepts the
   invite (while authenticated), they are added as a member with the invited
   role.
   Anyone with the link can look the invitation up through the API, but only
   the invited account sees the address in full; everyone else sees it
   masked, for example `a•••@example.com`.

Only a user signed in with the invited address (compared without regard to
case) can accept it. Anyone else gets `403` with code `invite_email_mismatch`.
The address must be ASCII, and an alias is a different address:
`alice+work@example.com` does not accept an invite sent to `alice@example.com`.

> An invitation cannot grant the `OWNER` role.
