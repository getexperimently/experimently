# JavaScript SDK

`@getexperimently/js-sdk` (v0.1.0) is the JavaScript/TypeScript client for the
Experimently public API: experiment assignment, feature flag evaluation and event
tracking for Node >= 18 and browsers. Zero runtime dependencies — it uses the global `fetch`.

By default, flag evaluation and experiment assignment are decided **by the server**: every call
goes to the public API with your `X-API-Key`, the server buckets the user (sticky per user +
experiment), and the SDK caches the answer per user + key. In server-side code you can opt in to
[local evaluation](#local-evaluation-server-side-beta) (`evaluation: 'local'`): flags are then
answered in-process from the server's ruleset, with the server's answers, and experiments stay on
the server.

Source: `sdk/js`. For React apps use the [React SDK](react.md); for edge runtimes the
[Edge SDK](edge.md); for the vendor-neutral API the [OpenFeature provider](openfeature.md), which
delegates to this package.

Verified against a live backend: **yes (2026-09-11)** via the contract smoke below.

## Installation

The `@getexperimently/js-sdk` package is on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@getexperimently/js-sdk).
0.1.0 is a beta release.

```bash
npm install @getexperimently/js-sdk@0.1.0
```

To work on the SDK itself, build it from a clone of this repository instead. `npm pack` writes
`getexperimently-js-sdk-0.1.0.tgz`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently.git
cd experimently/sdk/js
npm ci && npm run build && npm pack
```

Then, in your app, install the packed tarball:

```bash
npm install /path/to/experimently/sdk/js/getexperimently-js-sdk-0.1.0.tgz
```

CommonJS build (`dist/index.js`) with type declarations; `import`/`require` both work.

---

## Quick start

```typescript
import { ExperimentationClient } from '@getexperimently/js-sdk';

const client = new ExperimentationClient({
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8000',   // origin only; the SDK appends /api/v1/...
  apiKey: process.env.EXPERIMENTLY_API_KEY!,
});

const user = { userId: 'user-123', attributes: { country: 'US', plan: 'pro' } };

// Sticky experiment assignment (POST /api/v1/tracking/assign); attributes are sent as `context`
const assignment = await client.getAssignment('checkout_button_color', user);
assignment.variantName;     // 'control' | 'treatment'
assignment.configuration;   // the variant's configuration object, or null

// Or just the name — 'control' (defaultVariant) when assignment fails
const variant = await client.getVariant('checkout_button_color', user);

// Feature flag (GET /api/v1/feature-flags/evaluate/{key}?user_id=...&context=<url-encoded attributes>)
const { key, enabled, config, reason } = await client.evaluateFlag('dark_mode', user);
const isEnabled = await client.isFeatureEnabled('dark_mode', user);   // false on failure

// Track a conversion for one experiment (POST /api/v1/tracking/track)
await client.track('user-123', 'purchase', { value: 49.99, experimentKey: 'checkout_button_color' });

// Track without a key: fans out to every cached assignment and flag for the user (see below)
await client.track('user-123', 'page_view', { properties: { page: '/checkout' } });
```

---

## Configuration (`ClientConfig`)

```typescript
const client = new ExperimentationClient({
  apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com', // Required. Backend origin; trailing slashes are stripped.
  apiKey: 'eptk_...',                // Required. Sent as X-API-Key.
  timeoutMs: 5000,                   // Per-request timeout (default 5000)
  cacheTtlMs: 300_000,               // Successful evaluations/assignments reused per user + key (default 5 min)
  defaultVariant: 'control',         // Returned by getVariant when assignment fails (default 'control')
  fetch: customFetch,                // Optional custom fetch (tests, polyfills); defaults to globalThis.fetch
  onError: (err, operation) => {},   // Optional; called when track / trackBatch (or, in local mode, refresh / flush / evaluate) swallow a failure
  evaluation: 'server',              // 'server' (default) or 'local' (server-side only; see Local evaluation)
});
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `apiUrl` | `string` | — | Backend origin, e.g. `https://api.example.com`; the SDK appends `/api/v1/...` |
| `apiKey` | `string` | — | API key, sent as `X-API-Key` |
| `timeoutMs` | `number` | `5000` | Per-request timeout (`AbortController`); also caps the 429 retry delay |
| `cacheTtlMs` | `number` | `300000` | TTL of successful evaluations/assignments, per user + key |
| `defaultVariant` | `string` | `'control'` | Variant name `getVariant` returns on failure |
| `fetch` | `typeof fetch` | global `fetch` | Custom fetch implementation |
| `onError` | `(error: ExperimentationError, op: 'track' \| 'trackBatch' \| 'refresh' \| 'flush' \| 'evaluate') => void` | — | Only way to observe swallowed failures; a throwing handler is itself swallowed. `'refresh'`, `'flush'` and `'evaluate'` occur only in local mode |
| `evaluation` | `'server' \| 'local'` | `'server'` | `'local'`: answer flags in-process from `GET /api/v1/sdk/ruleset`; needs a key with the `sdk:ruleset` scope; throws in a browser |
| `refreshIntervalMs` | `number` | `30000` | Local mode: ruleset refresh interval (minimum 5000, ±10% jitter) |
| `maxStaleMs` | `number` | none | Local mode: evaluate on the server once the ruleset has not been refreshed for this long |

The constructor throws a plain `Error` (`apiKey is required` / `apiUrl is required`) when either
required field is missing, when `evaluation` is not `'server'` or `'local'`, and when
`evaluation: 'local'` is used in a browser.

### `UserContext`

```typescript
interface UserContext {
  userId: string;                       // stable id; the server buckets on it
  attributes?: Record<string, unknown>; // sent as `context` on assignment and on flag evaluation (targeting rules)
}
```

### Targeting context

`attributes` is what the platform's targeting rules evaluate against. It is sent as `context` in
the `POST /api/v1/tracking/assign` body and, when it is a non-empty object, as
`context=<url-encoded JSON>` on `GET /api/v1/feature-flags/evaluate/{flagKey}` (and on
`getAllFlags(userId, attributes)`), so a flag whose dashboard rule says
`os_version semver_gte 17.0.0 AND tier equals premium` turns on only for matching users. Top-level
keys are also reachable under `user.` / `device.` / `app.` aliases in rules (`country` matches
`user.country`), and nested objects flatten to dotted keys (`{ app: { version: '3.2.1' } }`
answers `app.version`).

Attributes are assumed **stable per user**: evaluations and assignments are cached by user + key
only, so call `clearCache()` after changing a user's attributes.

`getAssignment` and `evaluateFlag` reject with `ExperimentationError` (`code: 'INVALID_RESPONSE'`,
`user.userId is required`) when `userId` is missing or empty; `getVariant` / `isFeatureEnabled`
turn that into their safe default.

## API

| Method | Signature | Returns | On failure |
|--------|-----------|---------|------------|
| `getAssignment` | `(experimentKey, user: UserContext) => Promise<Assignment>` | `{ experimentKey, userId, variantId, variantName, isControl, configuration, assigned?, reason? }` | Rejects with `ExperimentationError` (404 when the experiment is not ACTIVE) |
| `getVariant` | `(experimentKey, user) => Promise<string>` | `assignment.variantName` | `defaultVariant` (`'control'`); never rejects |
| `evaluateFlag` | `(flagKey, user) => Promise<FlagEvaluation>` | `{ key, enabled, config, reason? }` (`user.attributes` sent as `context`) | Rejects with `ExperimentationError` (off with `reason: "inactive"` when the flag exists but is not ACTIVE; 404 only for an unknown key) |
| `isFeatureEnabled` | `(flagKey, user) => Promise<boolean>` | `evaluation.enabled` | `false`; never rejects |
| `getAllFlags` | `(userId, attributes?) => Promise<Record<string, boolean>>` | `{ flagKey: enabled }`; `attributes` sent as `context`; not cached, not part of the fan-out | Rejects |
| `track` | `(userId, eventName, options?: TrackOptions) => Promise<void>` | — | Never rejects; `onError(err, 'track')` |
| `trackBatch` | `(events: TrackEvent[]) => Promise<BatchResult>` | `{ successCount, failureCount, errors }` | Never rejects; a failed chunk counts all its events as failures and calls `onError(err, 'trackBatch')` |
| `fetchAssignments` | `(userId, { activeOnly?: boolean } = { activeOnly: true }) => Promise<AssignmentRecord[]>` | Server-side assignment rows (raw objects); not cached | Rejects |
| `getAssignments` | `(userId) => Assignment[]` | Cached, unexpired assignments in assignment order (no network) | — |
| `getEvaluatedFlags` | `(userId) => string[]` | Keys of cached, successfully evaluated flags (no network) | — |
| `clearCache` | `() => void` | Drops both caches | — |
| `ready` | `({ timeoutMs? }?) => Promise<ReadyResult>` | `{ ok: true, rulesetVersion }` or `{ ok: false, error }`; `{ ok: true, rulesetVersion: null }` at once in server mode | Never rejects |
| `status` | `() => LocalEvaluationStatus` | `{ evaluation, ready, rulesetVersion, lastRefreshAt, lastError, serverEvaluatedFlags }` | — |
| `close` | `() => Promise<void>` | Local mode: stops the ruleset refresh and sends the remaining evaluation counts; later calls are evaluated by the server. A no-op in server mode | Never rejects |

### Enrolment: `assigned` and `reason`

An `Assignment` also carries `assigned` and `reason`. `assigned: false` means the server did not
enrol the user (`reason` is `'holdout'`, `'mutual_exclusion'` or `'targeting'`) and returned the
control variant so you render the default experience; no exposure was recorded. **When you export
exposures to a warehouse, exclude assignments with `assigned: false`**: the user was not enrolled,
and `reason` says why. A server that predates the fields sends neither, so `assigned` is
`undefined` (never `false`). Decide deliberately how to treat those rows rather than dropping them
with an `assigned === true` filter.

`TrackOptions`: `value?` (number), `properties?` (sent as `metadata`), `experimentKey?`,
`featureFlagKey?`, `eventType?` (defaults to the event name), `timestamp?` (`Date` or string, sent as
ISO-8601). `TrackEvent` = `TrackOptions & { userId, eventName }`.

### Tracking and the fan-out rule

- With `experimentKey` and/or `featureFlagKey`: exactly one `POST /api/v1/tracking/track`.
- Without a key: one `POST /api/v1/tracking/batch` (chunked at 100) containing one entry per
  experiment the user has been assigned to in this client (`experiment_key`) plus one per flag
  evaluated for the user (`feature_flag_key`), taken from the cache. **If nothing is cached, nothing
  is sent.** This is what makes a single `track(userId, 'purchase', …)` count as a conversion for
  every experiment the user is in.
- `trackBatch` applies the same expansion to keyless entries, then sends everything in chunks of 100
  and sums the server's `success_count` / `failure_count` / `errors`.

Conversions are matched to metrics by **event name**.

### Caching, dedupe and retries

- Successful assignments and evaluations are cached per user + key for `cacheTtlMs`; failures are
  never cached, so the next call retries.
- Concurrent calls for the same user + key share one in-flight request (one assignment, one
  exposure event).
- A `429` is retried once after the server's `Retry-After` (seconds or HTTP date; default 1 s,
  capped at `timeoutMs`).

### Errors

`getAssignment`, `evaluateFlag`, `getAllFlags` and `fetchAssignments` reject with
`ExperimentationError` (`name === 'ExperimentationError'`):

| `code` | Meaning | `status` |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `HTTP_ERROR` | Non-2xx response; `body` holds the parsed JSON error (e.g. `{detail}`) | HTTP status (401 bad key, 404 not ACTIVE / unknown, 422, 429 after the retry) |
| `NETWORK_ERROR` | `fetch` rejected (DNS, connection refused, CORS, no fetch available) | `undefined` |
| `TIMEOUT` | The request exceeded `timeoutMs` | `undefined` |
| `INVALID_RESPONSE` | 2xx but the body is not what the SDK expects (or `userId` missing) | HTTP status or `undefined` |

```typescript
import { ExperimentationClient, ExperimentationError } from '@getexperimently/js-sdk';

try {
  const a = await client.getAssignment('checkout_flow', user);
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof ExperimentationError && err.status === 404) {
    // experiment is not ACTIVE — fall back to control
  }
}
```

## Backend endpoints used

Every request carries `X-API-Key`, `Content-Type: application/json` and `Accept: application/json`.
`apiUrl` is the origin only; the SDK appends the paths below.

| SDK call | Method and path | Body / query | 200 response |
|---|---|---|---|
| `getAssignment`, `getVariant` | `POST /api/v1/tracking/assign` | `{"experiment_key","user_id","context"?: object}` | `{"experiment_key","user_id","variant_id","variant_name","is_control","configuration"}` |
| `evaluateFlag`, `isFeatureEnabled` | `GET /api/v1/feature-flags/evaluate/{flag_key}?user_id=<id>&context=<url-encoded JSON>` | `context` = `user.attributes` (omitted when empty) | `{"key","enabled","config","reason"}` |
| `getAllFlags` | `GET /api/v1/feature-flags/user/{user_id}?context=<url-encoded JSON>` | `context` = `attributes` (omitted when empty) | `{"<flag_key>": bool, ...}` |
| `track` with a key | `POST /api/v1/tracking/track` | `{"event_type","event_name","user_id","experiment_key"?,"feature_flag_key"?,"value"?,"metadata"?,"timestamp"?}` | stored event (ignored) |
| `track` without a key, `trackBatch` | `POST /api/v1/tracking/batch` | `{"events":[<track body>...]}` (max 100) | `{"success_count","failure_count","errors"}` |
| `fetchAssignments` | `GET /api/v1/tracking/assignments/{user_id}?active_only=true` | — | list of assignment rows |
| local mode: ruleset refresh | `GET /api/v1/sdk/ruleset` (beta) | `If-None-Match: "<version>"` | the ruleset, `ETag`; `304` when unchanged |
| local mode: evaluation counts | `POST /api/v1/tracking/evaluations` (beta) | `{"evaluations":[{"flag_key","count","enabled_count","window_start","window_end"}]}` | `{"accepted","errors"}` |

Errors: 401 bad key; 404 experiment/flag not ACTIVE or unknown; 422 invalid event; 429
rate limited (`Retry-After` header, retried once).

## TypeScript types

```typescript
import type {
  ClientConfig, UserContext, Assignment, FlagEvaluation,
  TrackOptions, TrackEvent, BatchResult, AssignmentRecord,
} from '@getexperimently/js-sdk';

interface Assignment {
  experimentKey: string;
  userId: string;
  variantId: string | null;
  variantName: string;
  isControl: boolean;
  configuration: Record<string, unknown> | null;
}

interface FlagEvaluation {
  key: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  config: unknown | null;
  reason?: string;     // 'targeting_rule' | 'rollout' | 'inactive' | 'error'; undefined when the server does not send it
  source?: 'server' | 'local'; // local mode only: answered in-process, or by the server
}

interface BatchResult {
  successCount: number;
  failureCount: number;
  errors: unknown[];   // server-reported per-event errors plus {message, status?} per failed chunk
}
```

The raw wire shapes (`AssignResponse`, `FlagEvaluateResponse`, `BatchResponse`, `TrackBody`) are
exported too.

---

## Hash utilities (compatibility only)

`consistentHash(userId, flagKey)`, `md5Hex(input)` and `md5Bytes(input)` are exported so the
cross-SDK golden-vector tests and custom integrations can verify parity:

```
MD5("{userId}:{flagKey}") → first 4 bytes as little-endian uint32 → ÷ 2^32 (4294967296)
consistentHash('user-123', 'my-flag') ≈ 0.6927449859
```

**Nothing in the SDK calls them to pick a variant or decide a flag.** `consistentHash` is not the
function the server buckets flag rollouts with: that is `md5-mod100-v1`, the whole MD5 digest of
`"{userId}:{flagKey}"` read as a big-endian integer, mod 100, which local evaluation reproduces
internally (`consistentHash('user-123', 'my-flag')` is bucket 69; the server puts that user in
bucket 79).

---

## Local evaluation (server-side, beta)

With `evaluation: 'local'` the client downloads the flag ruleset (`GET /api/v1/sdk/ruleset`),
refreshes it every `refreshIntervalMs` (30 s by default, 5 s minimum), and answers `evaluateFlag`,
`isFeatureEnabled` and `getAllFlags` in-process whenever it can give exactly the server's answer;
otherwise it makes the usual request. Experiments are always assigned by the server. It needs an
Experimently server at 0.11.0 or later and a key with the `sdk:ruleset` scope, and it is for
server-side code only: the constructor throws in a browser.

```typescript
const client = new ExperimentationClient({
  apiUrl: process.env.EXPERIMENTLY_API_URL!,
  apiKey: process.env.EXPERIMENTLY_SERVER_KEY!, // sdk:ruleset scope
  evaluation: 'local',
});
await client.ready({ timeoutMs: 5_000 });        // optional; never rejects
const { enabled, reason, source } = await client.evaluateFlag('new_search', user); // source: 'local' | 'server'
await client.close();                            // on shutdown: sends the evaluation counts
```

A change made in the dashboard reaches the process at its next successful refresh. While the API
is unreachable the last ruleset keeps being served (set `maxStaleMs` to bound that); a 401 or 403
on refresh discards it. What is answered locally, the refresh failure table, safety monitoring and
troubleshooting: [Local evaluation](local-evaluation.md).

---

## Browser vs Node.js

The SDK is isomorphic. In the browser the API key is visible to end users, and keys are not scoped
for browser use: every active key, including one shipped to a browser, can evaluate flags and track
events as the user who created it. Use a dedicated key for browser traffic so it can be revoked on its
own, and never give it the `sdk:ruleset` scope, which lets a key download every flag's targeting
rules. Server-side, lower `timeoutMs` if the SDK sits on a request path:

```typescript
const client = new ExperimentationClient({
  apiUrl: process.env.EXPERIMENTLY_API_URL!,
  apiKey: process.env.EXPERIMENTLY_API_KEY!,
  timeoutMs: 1000,
});
```

---

## Contract smoke

```bash
cd sdk/js && npm run build --silent && node examples/contract_smoke.mjs
```

It prints one line:

```json
{"sdk":"js","assign":{"variant_name":"control","is_control":true,"sticky":true},"flag":{"enabled":true},"track":{"ok":true},"fanout":{"ok":true}}
```

Env: `EXPERIMENTLY_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:8000`), `EXPERIMENTLY_API_KEY` (required),
`CONTRACT_EXPERIMENT_KEY` (default `sdk_contract_ab`), `CONTRACT_FLAG_KEY` (default
`sdk_contract_flag`), `CONTRACT_USER_ID` (default random `smoke-<uuid>`). The script assigns twice
(sticky), evaluates the flag, tracks `purchase` with a key, tracks `page_view` without a key
(fan-out) and sends a 2-event `trackBatch`. `npm run smoke` is a shortcut.

With a seeded backend (`python backend/scripts/seed_sdk_contract.py`):
`python tests/sdk-contract/live/run_live_contract.py --sdk js --strict`. That also runs
`examples/local_eval_smoke.mjs` with the seed's `sdk:ruleset` key (the `js (local)` row): 40
evaluations answered locally, the counts sent on `close()`, then two client errors, and the runner
checks in the database that no evaluate call was made and that the safety monitor's denominator
grew by exactly 40.

---

## Development

`npx jest` runs the unit tests, with `fetch` mocked; `npm run build` runs `tsc` into `dist/`
(CommonJS and `.d.ts`):

```bash
cd sdk/js && npm install
npx jest
npm run build
```
