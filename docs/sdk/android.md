# Android Kotlin SDK

The Android SDK (`com.experimentationplatform.android`) provides feature flag evaluation,
experiment assignment and event tracking for Android applications. It is built on Kotlin
Coroutines and OkHttp, persists the last successful results to `SharedPreferences` for offline
fallback, and its unit tests run on the plain JVM with OkHttp's `MockWebServer`.

Flag evaluation and experiment assignment are decided **by the server**: every call goes to the
public API with your `X-API-Key`, the server buckets the user (sticky per user + experiment), and
the SDK caches the answer per user + key. Nothing is bucketed locally.

Source: `sdk/android` (module `sdk/android/sdk`, Compose example in `sdk/android/examples`).

> **Not executed here.** No gradle / Android SDK is installed on the development machine, so the
> rewire onto the public API was reviewed line by line but the module has not been compiled and
> its unit tests have not been run. Android has no contract smoke (it needs a device runtime) and
> no entry in the live runner manifest `tests/sdk-contract/live/run_live_contract.py`.

---

## Requirements

- Android `minSdk 21`, `compileSdk 34`
- Kotlin 1.9, `kotlinx-coroutines-android` 1.7, OkHttp 4.12 (declared by the module)
- JDK 17 for the build

---

## Installation

The module is not published to Maven yet; consume it from source.

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts
include(":sdk")
project(":sdk").projectDir = file("../experimentation-platform/sdk/android/sdk")

// build.gradle.kts (app module)
dependencies {
    implementation(project(":sdk"))
}
```

---

## Quick Start

```kotlin
import com.experimentationplatform.android.ExperimentationClient
import com.experimentationplatform.android.SdkConfig
import com.experimentationplatform.android.TrackEvent
import com.experimentationplatform.android.User

val client = ExperimentationClient(
    SdkConfig(
        baseUrl = "http://10.0.2.2:8000",           // origin only; the SDK appends /api/v1/...
        apiKey = BuildConfig.EXPERIMENTLY_API_KEY   // sent as X-API-Key
    )
)

lifecycleScope.launch {
    val user = User(id = "user-123", attributes = mapOf("plan" to "pro", "country" to "US"))

    val flag = client.evaluateFlag("new-checkout", user)          // server decides
    if (flag.enabled) showNewCheckout()

    val assignment = client.getAssignment("checkout-cta-copy", user)   // sticky on the server
    updateCtaCopy(assignment.variantName, assignment.configuration)

    client.track(TrackEvent(user.id, "purchase", mapOf("sku" to "pro-plan"),
        experimentKey = "checkout-cta-copy", value = 99.99))
}
```

`http://10.0.2.2:8000` reaches a backend on the host machine from the emulator. Seed a working
experiment, flag and API key with `python backend/scripts/seed_sdk_contract.py` (the key is
written to `tests/sdk-contract/live/.api_key`).

---

## Configuration

```kotlin
val config = SdkConfig(
    baseUrl = "https://api.example.com",   // Required — origin only
    apiKey = "your-api-key",               // Required — sent as X-API-Key
    timeoutMs = 10_000L,                   // OkHttp connect/read/write timeout (default 10 s)
    cacheSize = 1000,                      // Max cached evaluations and, separately, assignments (default 1000)
    cacheTtlMs = 300_000L                  // How long a successful result is reused (default 5 min)
)
val client = ExperimentationClient(config)
```

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `baseUrl` | `String` | `http://localhost:8000` | Backend origin, e.g. `https://api.example.com`; the SDK appends `/api/v1/...` |
| `apiKey` | `String` | *(required)* | API key sent as `X-API-Key` |
| `timeoutMs` | `Long` | `10000` | OkHttp connect, read and write timeout in milliseconds |
| `cacheSize` | `Int` | `1000` | Maximum LRU entries per cache (evaluations, assignments) |
| `cacheTtlMs` | `Long` | `300000` | Milliseconds a successful evaluation/assignment is reused |
| `enableLocalEval` | `Boolean` | — | Deprecated; has no effect (flags are evaluated by the server) |

`ExperimentationClient(config, httpClient, flagCache, assignmentCache, offlineStore)` accepts
every collaborator for injection. `OfflineStore()` without arguments is in-memory (tests); in an
app pass an `OfflineStore.PrefsAdapter` wrapping `SharedPreferences`:

```kotlin
class PrefsAdapter(private val prefs: SharedPreferences) : OfflineStore.PrefsAdapter {
    override fun getString(key: String) = prefs.getString(key, null)
    override fun putString(key: String, value: String) { prefs.edit().putString(key, value).apply() }
    override fun remove(key: String) { prefs.edit().remove(key).apply() }
    override fun allKeys() = prefs.all.keys
    override fun clear() { prefs.edit().clear().apply() }
}

val client = ExperimentationClient(
    config,
    offlineStore = OfflineStore(PrefsAdapter(context.getSharedPreferences("experimently", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)))
)
```

---

## Lifecycle

Share one `ExperimentationClient` per process (an `Application` field or a DI singleton). Call
`close()` when it is no longer needed (`ViewModel.onCleared`, `Activity.onDestroy`); it drops the
in-memory caches. Events already handed to `track` keep flushing in the background.

---

## User model

```kotlin
val user = User(
    id = "user-123",                                      // stable identifier, required
    attributes = mapOf("plan" to "pro", "country" to "US", "beta" to true)
)
```

`attributes` are sent as the assignment `context` (targeting rules). Values may be `String`,
`Int`, `Long`, `Double`, `Boolean`, nested `Map`/`List` or `null`. The flag evaluation endpoint
only takes the user id.

---

## Feature Flag Evaluation

### `suspend fun evaluateFlag(flagKey: String, user: User): EvalResult`

Calls `GET /api/v1/feature-flags/evaluate/{flagKey}?user_id=…` (both values percent-encoded).

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `key` | `String` | The flag key you asked for |
| `enabled` | `Boolean` | Server decision for this user |
| `config` | `Any?` | The flag's `config` payload: `Map<String, Any?>` for a JSON object, `List<Any?>` for an array, a scalar, or `null` |
| `configMap` | `Map<String, Any?>?` | `config` when it is a JSON object, else `null` |
| `variant` | `String?` | `null` when off; `config["variant"]` when it is a string; otherwise `"on"` |

```kotlin
val result = client.evaluateFlag("dark-mode", user)
if (result.enabled) {
    val theme = result.configMap?.get("theme") as? String ?: "dark"
}
```

Resolution order: the in-memory cache for this user + flag, then the API, then (on failure) the
offline store's last successful evaluation for this user + flag. Failures are never cached; an
offline fallback is returned without being re-cached, so the next call retries the server. With
no offline value the call **throws** — `FlagNotFoundException` on 404 (flag unknown or not
ACTIVE), `ServerException` on another non-2xx status, `NetworkException` on IO errors — which is
what the SDK did before the rewire.

---

## Experiment Assignment

### `suspend fun getAssignment(experimentKey: String, user: User): Assignment`

Calls `POST /api/v1/tracking/assign` with `{experiment_key, user_id, context}` (`context` is
omitted when the user has no attributes). The server buckets the user, keeps the assignment
sticky and records the exposure.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `experimentKey` | `String` | The experiment key |
| `userId` | `String` | The assigned user |
| `variantId` | `String?` | UUID of the assigned variant |
| `variantName` | `String` | Assigned variant name (e.g. `"control"`, `"treatment"`) |
| `isControl` | `Boolean` | `true` for the control variant |
| `configuration` | `Map<String, Any?>?` | The variant's `configuration` JSON from the experiment definition |
| `variantKey` | `String` | Deprecated alias for `variantName` |

```kotlin
val assignment = client.getAssignment("checkout-cta-copy", user)
when (assignment.variantName) {
    "treatment-a" -> renderShortCta()
    "treatment-b" -> renderUrgencyCta()
    else          -> renderOriginalCta()
}
```

Successful assignments are cached per user + experiment for `cacheTtlMs` (the second call makes
no request) and persisted to the offline store. On failure the offline value is returned if one
exists; otherwise `ServerException` (404 when the experiment is not ACTIVE, 401 bad key, 429
rate limited) or `NetworkException` is thrown. Failures are never cached.

---

## Event Tracking

### `suspend fun track(event: TrackEvent)`

Fire-and-forget: the request runs on a background `Dispatchers.IO` scope and **never throws**.
Events with an empty `userId` or `eventName` are ignored.

```kotlin
data class TrackEvent(
    val userId: String,
    val eventName: String,
    val properties: Map<String, Any?> = emptyMap(),   // sent as metadata
    val experimentKey: String? = null,
    val featureFlagKey: String? = null,
    val value: Double? = null,
    val eventType: String? = null,                    // defaults to eventName
    val timestampMs: Long? = null                     // sent as ISO-8601 UTC when set
)
```

```kotlin
client.track(TrackEvent(user.id, "purchase", mapOf("sku" to "pro-plan"), experimentKey = "checkout-cta-copy", value = 99.99))
client.track(TrackEvent(user.id, "search", featureFlagKey = "new-search"))
client.track(TrackEvent(user.id, "page_view", mapOf("page" to "/products")))   // no key: fanned out
```

**Fan-out rule.** With `experimentKey` and/or `featureFlagKey` the SDK sends one
`POST /api/v1/tracking/track`. Without a key it sends one `POST /api/v1/tracking/batch`
containing one entry per experiment the user has been assigned to through this client plus one
per flag evaluated for the user (from the in-memory cache). If nothing is cached, nothing is
sent. This is what makes a single `track("purchase")` count as a conversion for every experiment
the user is in. Conversions are matched to metrics by **event name**.

### `suspend fun trackBatch(events: List<TrackEvent>)`

Sends `POST /api/v1/tracking/batch` with at most 100 events per request (longer lists are
chunked). Keyed events are sent as-is; unkeyed events are fanned out like `track`, and unkeyed
events whose user has nothing cached are dropped. Never throws.

---

## Cache helpers

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `getCachedAssignments(userId): List<Assignment>` | Cached (successful, unexpired) assignments for the user |
| `getCachedFlagKeys(userId): List<String>` | Keys of flags successfully evaluated (and still cached) for the user |
| `invalidateCache(userId, key)` | Drop the evaluation and assignment for one user + key from memory and the offline store |
| `clearCache()` | Drop every in-memory evaluation and assignment (the offline store is kept) |
| `getCacheSize(): Int` | Cached evaluations plus assignments |

The in-memory caches are thread-safe LRU maps (`ResultCache`) keyed by `userId`, a NUL
separator and the flag/experiment `key`.
The offline store keys are `ep_flag_<len>_<userId>_<key>` / `ep_assign_<len>_<userId>_<key>`.

---

## Backend endpoints used

Every request carries `X-API-Key`, `Content-Type: application/json` and `Accept: application/json`.

| SDK call | Method and path | Body / query | Response used |
|---|---|---|---|
| `evaluateFlag` | `GET /api/v1/feature-flags/evaluate/{flag_key}?user_id=…` | — | `{key, enabled, config}`; 404 when the flag is not ACTIVE |
| `getAssignment` | `POST /api/v1/tracking/assign` | `{experiment_key, user_id, context?}` | `{experiment_key, user_id, variant_id, variant_name, is_control, configuration}`; 404 when the experiment is not ACTIVE |
| `track` with a key | `POST /api/v1/tracking/track` | `{event_type, event_name, user_id, experiment_key?, feature_flag_key?, value?, metadata?, timestamp?}` | ignored |
| `track` without keys, `trackBatch` | `POST /api/v1/tracking/batch` | `{events: [<track body>, …]}` (max 100 per request) | ignored |

These SDK paths share a per-IP rate-limit ceiling of `SDK_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` requests
(default 6000) on the backend; a `429` surfaces as `ServerException(429, …)`. The former
`/api/v1/feature-flags/{key}`, `/api/v1/feature-flags` (list), `/api/v1/experiments/{key}/assign`
and `/api/v1/events` calls, the `Authorization: ApiKey` header and `refreshFlags()` are gone.

---

## Error Handling

`evaluateFlag` and `getAssignment` throw `ExperimentationException` subclasses when the API
fails and no offline value exists; `track`/`trackBatch` never throw.

| Class | When |
|-------|------|
| `ExperimentationException.NetworkException(message, cause)` | OkHttp IO failure or timeout |
| `ExperimentationException.ServerException(statusCode, message)` | Non-2xx response: 401 bad key, 404 unknown/not ACTIVE (assignment), 422 invalid event, 429 rate limited; `message` carries the API's `detail` |
| `ExperimentationException.FlagNotFoundException(flagKey)` | `evaluateFlag` got a 404 and nothing is stored offline |
| `ExperimentationException.InvalidConfigException(message)` | Reserved for configuration errors |

```kotlin
try {
    val result = client.evaluateFlag("my-flag", user)
} catch (e: ExperimentationException.FlagNotFoundException) {
    // flag unknown or not ACTIVE → treat as off
} catch (e: ExperimentationException.NetworkException) {
    // offline and nothing stored → treat as off
} catch (e: ExperimentationException.ServerException) {
    Log.w("exp", "API error ${e.statusCode}: ${e.message}")
}
```

`evaluateFlag`/`getAssignment` also throw `IllegalArgumentException` for an empty key or user id.

---

## Consistent Hash Utility

`ConsistentHash.compute(userId: String, key: String): Double` implements the cross-SDK formula —
`MD5("{userId}:{key}")`, first 4 bytes as little-endian uint32, divided by 2^32 — and is pinned by
the golden vectors in `tests/sdk-contract/golden-vectors.json` (`HashCompatibilityTest`):

```kotlin
ConsistentHash.compute("user-123", "my-flag")   // 0.6927449859213084
```

It is exported as a utility only. Since assignment moved to the server, nothing in the SDK uses
it to decide a variant. `FeatureFlagEvaluator.hashUser` remains as a deprecated alias.

---

## Jetpack Compose

```kotlin
@Composable
fun DashboardScreen(client: ExperimentationClient, user: User) {
    var showNewDashboard by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

    LaunchedEffect(user.id) {
        showNewDashboard = try {
            client.evaluateFlag("new-dashboard", user).enabled
        } catch (e: ExperimentationException) {
            false
        }
    }

    if (showNewDashboard) NewDashboard() else LegacyDashboard()
}
```

A complete Activity is in `sdk/android/examples/ComposeExample/ExampleActivity.kt`.

---

## Testing your own code

Point the client at OkHttp's `MockWebServer` (the SDK's own tests do this) or inject fakes
through the constructor:

```kotlin
val server = MockWebServer().apply { start() }
server.enqueue(MockResponse().setResponseCode(200)
    .setBody("""{"key":"new-checkout","enabled":true,"config":null}"""))

val client = ExperimentationClient(SdkConfig(baseUrl = server.url("/").toString().trimEnd('/'), apiKey = "test"))

runTest {
    assertTrue(client.evaluateFlag("new-checkout", User("u1")).enabled)
    val request = server.takeRequest()
    assertEquals("/api/v1/feature-flags/evaluate/new-checkout?user_id=u1", request.path)
    assertEquals("test", request.getHeader("X-API-Key"))
}
```

---

## Development and verification

```bash
cd sdk/android && gradle :sdk:test   # JUnit 5 + MockWebServer, 78 tests (no wrapper checked in)
```

`ExperimentationClientTest` (56 tests) covers the exact request for each endpoint (method, path
encoding, `user_id` query, headers, JSON body), response mapping, sticky cache hits, TTL expiry,
404/401/network failures, offline fallback, that failures are never cached, keyed `track`
bodies, key-less fan-out, "nothing cached → no request", batch chunking at 100 and that `track`
never throws. `HashCompatibilityTest` (22 tests) pins the golden vectors.

Unit tests only (JUnit 5 + MockWebServer); no contract smoke (needs a device runtime). The live
runner manifest in `tests/sdk-contract/live/run_live_contract.py` has no `android` entry.

Verified against a live backend: **not yet (toolchain unavailable — no gradle/Android SDK on the
development machine)**. The unit tests have not been executed on this machine either; the code
was reviewed by inspection only.
