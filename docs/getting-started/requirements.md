# Requirements for Experimentation Platform

This document outlines the core requirements for an experimentation platform, incorporating both real-time testing capabilities and feature flag functionality.

## 1. Experiment Creation and Management

-   **Experiment Setup**: Ability to create new experiments with key details such as experiment name, description, hypothesis, goals, success criteria, and metrics.

-   **Experiment Types**: Support A/B testing, multivariate testing, split URL testing, and multi-armed bandit testing.

-   **Variants Management**: Create and manage multiple variants for each experiment and assign traffic distribution percentages.

-   **Segmentation**: Allow segmentation of users for targeted experiments based on attributes (e.g., location, device, behavior).

-   **Scheduling**: Schedule the start and end time for experiments and adjust experiment duration.

-   **Real-Time Experiment Control**: Enable real-time start/stop and switching between experiment variants without downtime.

## 2. Metrics and Events Tracking

-   **Custom Metrics**: Allow users to define custom metrics (e.g., conversion rate, user engagement) to track during experiments.

-   **Event Logging**: Track events like clicks, form submissions, purchases, etc., and link them to experiment variants.

-   **Real-Time Metrics Reporting**: Display live metrics and performance updates on dashboards.

-   **Instant Statistical Analysis**: Provide fast statistical analysis to determine significance in real time and suggest stopping criteria.

## 3. Randomization and Traffic Allocation

-   **Random User Assignment**: Automatically assign users to experiment variants randomly and ensure proper distribution.

-   **Traffic Allocation**: Provide the ability to control traffic allocation to different variants (e.g., 50/50, 80/20).

-   **Real-Time Allocation Adjustments**: Allow dynamic adjustment of traffic allocation during ongoing experiments.

## 4. Feature Flags Integration

-   **Feature Flag Management**: Allow users to create, manage, and configure feature flags (enable/disable certain features or experiments for specific users).

-   **Targeting Rules**: Define targeting criteria for feature flags based on user attributes, experiment participation, etc.

-   **Real-Time Feature Control**: Enable instant toggling of feature flags and experiment variants without redeploying code.

-   **Multivariate Flag Configuration**: Support multiple flag variants for complex testing scenarios.

-   **Gradual Rollouts**: Implement gradual feature rollouts with percentage-based activation (e.g., 10% of users on day 1, 50% on day 3).

-   **Rollback Support**: Allow for immediate rollback of features or variants in case of issues.

-   **Feature Flag Evaluation**: Implement a low-latency system for evaluating which feature or variant a user should see.

## 5. User Access Control and Permissions

-   **User Roles and Permissions**: Define user roles (e.g., Admin, Analyst, Viewer) with different levels of access.

-   **Experiment Permissions**: Implement permissions for experiment creation, modification, and result viewing.

-   **Audit Logs**: Track and maintain logs of user activities and changes to experiments.

## 6. Results and Analysis

-   **Statistical Analysis**: Run automated statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests) to assess the significance of experiment results.
