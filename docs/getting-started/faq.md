# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is Experimently?

Experimently is a self-hosted experimentation platform for running A/B tests, feature flags, and controlled rollouts. It provides a complete solution for data-driven product development: design experiments, assign users to variants, track conversion events, run statistical analysis, and make shipping decisions — all in one platform.

The platform includes a REST API backend (FastAPI), a React management dashboard, client SDKs (JavaScript, Python, Java, React), and AWS CDK infrastructure code.

---

### Is it open source and self-hostable?

Yes. The platform is designed to be deployed in your own AWS account using the provided CDK infrastructure definitions. You own your data and control your deployment. There is no vendor lock-in and no data leaves your infrastructure.

Running `cdk deploy --all` from the `infrastructure/cdk/` directory provisions the AWS environment: the API and the dashboard as ECS Fargate services behind one Application Load Balancer, the Aurora PostgreSQL database, the Redis cache and Lambda functions. The dashboard starts on the `web:bootstrap` image you push first. After that, each run of the Deploy workflow rolls the release onto the dashboard too: it builds the release's dashboard image (or reuses the one already in ECR for that version), registers a new dashboard task definition with it, rolls the dashboard service onto it once the API is serving the same release, and smoke-tests the dashboard through the public URL ([Deployment Guide](../deployment/deployment-guide.md)). The CDK does not create a CloudFront distribution. A checkout that also has `modules/` gets the real-time DynamoDB counters table and the Kinesis/OpenSearch/Glue data lake alongside them — see [AWS CDK Deployment](../self-hosting/cdk.md) for which stacks each profile deploys.

---

### What AWS services does it require?

A full production deployment uses the following AWS services:

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| ECS Fargate | Hosts the FastAPI application |
| Aurora PostgreSQL | Primary relational database |
| ElastiCache Redis | Session storage and caching |
| DynamoDB | Real-time impression and conversion counters |
| Lambda | No request or event processing: placeholder functions that do nothing, and a daily Glue ETL trigger in the full profile. Assignment and flag evaluation are API calls ([AWS Integration](../integrations/aws.md#lambda-functions)) |
| CloudFront | Not created by the CDK. Only needed if you wire in the split-URL module's Lambda@Edge construct yourself |
| Kinesis | Full profile only: a stream feeding Firehose and the S3 data lake. The API does not write to it today |
| OpenSearch | Full profile only: a domain is created; nothing writes to it today |
| Cognito | User authentication and JWT token issuance |
| S3 | Full profile only: the analytics data lake, Athena results and Glue scripts. The dashboard is an ECS service, not files in S3 |
| CloudWatch | Logging, metrics, and dashboards |
| Secrets Manager | Encrypted storage for API keys and credentials |
| CodeDeploy | Blue/green deployments for the API service |

For local development, Docker Compose provides PostgreSQL and Redis, and LocalStack can emulate most AWS services.

### How is user assignment consistent across requests?

User-to-variant assignment uses a **deterministic consistent hash** of `experiment_key + user_id`. Because the hash is deterministic, the same user always receives the same variant for a given experiment — regardless of which server processes the request, whether the cache is warm, or whether the SDK has been restarted.

The hash decides a new user's variant from the experiment's traffic weights. The API then stores the assignment, and a user who already has one gets it back unchanged, even if the weights have changed since.

---

### What statistical methods are supported?

The platform supports a range of statistical approaches:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Frequentist (Fisher's exact test) | Each treatment against the control: a two-sided Fisher's exact test on the users who converted and the users who did not. Every metric in the results is analysed as a conversion today; warehouse analysis (beta) compares a mean metric with Welch's t-test |
| Sequential testing (mSPRT) | Continuous monitoring with valid p-values at any sample size |
| Always-valid confidence intervals | Confidence sequences that are valid at every look |
| Alpha spending (O'Brien-Fleming, Pocock) | Not computed yet: the response's `alpha_spending` is empty; use the mSPRT, which is valid under continuous monitoring |
| CUPED | Variance reduction from each user's own events before assignment (API only) |
| Bayesian (Beta-Binomial) | Posterior credible intervals, Bayes factors, probability of superiority, ROPE (priors and thresholds through the API only) |
| Multi-armed bandit | Thompson Sampling, UCB1, and Epsilon-Greedy adaptive traffic allocation |
| Dimensional analysis | Segment-level breakdowns with Bonferroni correction and heterogeneous treatment effect detection |
| Interaction detection (beta) | Jaccard overlap between experiments; whether one experiment's lift on its primary conversion metric differs across another's arms (API only) |

[What the dashboard does, and what is API only](../guides/dashboard-and-api.md) says which of these the
dashboard shows.

### What SDKs are available?

The JavaScript SDK is on npm (`npm install @getexperimently/js-sdk`, 0.1.0, beta) and the
Python SDK is on PyPI (`pip install experimently`, 0.1.0, beta). **The others are not published
yet:** none of them is on its registry, so installing them by name fails today. Each SDK's page
([Java](../sdk/java.md), [React](../sdk/react.md)) says how to install it from this repository
instead.

| SDK | Package |
|-----|---------|
| JavaScript / TypeScript | `@getexperimently/js-sdk` (npm) |
| Python | `experimently` (PyPI) |
| Java / JVM | `com.getexperimently:experimently-sdk` (Maven/Gradle) |
| React | `@getexperimently/react-sdk` (npm) |

All SDKs support experiment variant assignment, feature flag evaluation, and event tracking. The Java SDK includes Spring Boot auto-configuration. The React SDK includes hooks, an HOC, and SSR support for Next.js.

## Getting Started

### How do I get started?

Follow the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md) to go from zero to a running experiment in under 30 minutes. The guide walks you through:

1. Cloning the repository and configuring environment variables
2. Starting PostgreSQL and Redis with Docker Compose
3. Running database migrations
4. Starting the FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend
5. Creating your first experiment via the UI or API
6. Tracking events and viewing results

For a full AWS deployment, see [CDK Deployment](../self-hosting/cdk.md).

### What is the difference between a feature flag and an experiment?

**Feature flags** control whether a feature is visible to a user. They are primarily operational tools — used for gradual rollouts, kill switches, and beta programs. A flag has no statistical analysis attached to it.

**Experiments** are scientific tools for causal measurement. They split users into variants, track defined metrics, and apply statistical tests to determine whether a variant is better than the control. Experiments have a defined start and end date and produce a ship/no-ship recommendation.

You can combine both: run a feature behind a flag during an experiment, then graduate the flag to 100% after the experiment concludes.

---

## Data and Analytics

### Can I use my own data warehouse?

Yes, if it is Snowflake or BigQuery. Warehouse analysis (beta, full profile) runs an experiment's analysis on your own tables, and each warehouse becomes available once its connector has been checked against a real account: Snowflake and BigQuery are available, and Amazon Athena is not yet. See [Warehouse analysis](../api/warehouse-analytics.md).

---

### How does CUPED variance reduction work?

CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) reduces result noise by adjusting each conversion rate for whether users sent the metric's event in the days before they were assigned. The adjustment uses a regression slope (`theta`) pooled within the experiment's arms.

When that history predicts the outcome, lower variance means you reach statistical significance with fewer users, or detect smaller effects with the same sample size. History counts only if the server received it before the user was assigned, so send it before you start the experiment. `GET /api/v1/results/{experiment_id}/cuped` reports it; see [CUPED documentation](../api/cuped.md).

---

### What is Bayesian experimentation vs frequentist?

**Frequentist** testing (the default) computes a p-value: the probability of seeing results as extreme as these if there were no true effect. You make a binary decision: reject the null hypothesis (p < 0.05) or fail to reject it.

**Bayesian** testing maintains a probability distribution over the possible true values of the metric. It gives you:

- A **credible interval**: the range where the true effect likely falls, with a specified probability
- **Probability of superiority**: P(treatment > control), a natural way to communicate results
- A **Bayes factor**: how much more likely the data is under the alternative hypothesis than the null
- A **stopping rule** that is mathematically valid for early stopping without inflating false-positive rates

Bayesian methods are more flexible for continuous monitoring and provide richer output than a binary p-value. Frequentist methods are more familiar, have established reporting conventions, and are often required for regulatory or compliance reporting.

See [Bayesian Experimentation API](../api/bayesian.md) to enable Bayesian analysis on your experiments.

### How does Split URL testing work?

Split URL testing redirects different user segments to different URLs — for example, `/checkout` vs `/checkout-v2` — at the CDN layer using Lambda@Edge.

The split-URL module ships a CloudFront construct with a Lambda@Edge router, which no stack uses: you add it to a stack yourself. The router reads a cookie to check whether the visitor has already been assigned. If not, it hashes the client fingerprint (IP address and User-Agent) to pick a variant, returns a 302 redirect to the variant URL, and sets a cookie that lasts `cookie_ttl_days` (30 days by default). A request that carries a cookie naming a known variant URL passes through without being bucketed again.

This approach provides zero-latency variant delivery (the redirect happens at the CDN edge, before the request reaches your origin) and works for full page-level experiments where the content differences are too large for a single-page A/B test.

See [Split URL Testing API](../api/split-url.md) for setup and the CDK construct reference.

## Compliance and Security

### What compliance certifications are supported?

The platform holds no certifications. It provides audit-trail controls that customers use as evidence in their own **SOC 2** or **ISO/IEC 27001** programs; the `compliance` module adds tamper-evident signing and report packs.

Creating, changing and deleting experiments and feature flags (and, in the full profile, warehouse connections, sources and analysis runs) is recorded in the compliance audit trail. With the `compliance` module each event is signed with HMAC-SHA256 under the `AUDIT_HMAC_KEY` setting; without it events are recorded unsigned. Logins, role changes and exports are not recorded yet.

Pre-built compliance reports are available at:
- `GET /api/v1/compliance/reports/soc2` — SOC 2 report, by default over the last 365 days
- `GET /api/v1/compliance/reports/iso27001` — ISO 27001 report, by default over the last 730 days

Full audit log export (JSON or CSV) is available for SIEM ingestion at `GET /api/v1/compliance/export`.

See [Compliance Audit Trail API](../api/compliance.md) for full documentation.

---

### Can I integrate with Jira, Salesforce, or GitHub?

Yes. The platform supports bidirectional integrations with all three:

- **Jira**: Link experiments to Jira issues and receive status transition events via webhook
- **Salesforce**: Push experiment results to Salesforce campaign objects via OAuth 2.0
- **GitHub**: Receive push/pull_request/issues events; webhook payloads are validated using HMAC-SHA256 against your webhook secret

Integrations are created by an ADMIN at `POST /api/v1/integrations`, are addressed by their type afterwards (`GET /api/v1/integrations/github`; there is one of each type), and have per-service webhook endpoints at `POST /api/v1/integrations/webhooks/github   (also /jira, /salesforce)`.

See [Integrations API](../api/integrations.md), [Salesforce Integration](../integrations/salesforce.md), and [GitHub Integration](../integrations/github.md) for detailed setup guides.

---

## Access Control

### What roles and permissions are available?

The platform uses a layered role-based access control system with four built-in roles:

| Role | What They Can Do |
|------|-----------------|
| **VIEWER** | Read-only access to approved experiments and results |
| **ANALYST** | View all experiments, results, audit logs, and reports |
| **DEVELOPER** | Create and manage experiments and feature flags; read integration settings, but not change them |
| **ADMIN** | Full access: user management, compliance exports, global settings, integrations |

Beyond the four base roles, admins can create **custom roles** with specific per-resource and per-action permissions. They can also grant **direct permission** to a user for a specific resource, with an optional expiry timestamp for temporary access. Both are stored and shown by `GET /api/v1/rbac/users/{user_id}/permissions`, but no permission check reads them yet: what a user can do is decided by their base role ([#891](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/891)).

See [RBAC API Reference](../api/rbac.md) for the full role and permission management API.

---

### How do API keys work?

API keys are used for SDK authentication and server-to-server calls. Unlike JWT tokens (which are user-session credentials), API keys are long-lived. Any active key authenticates every API-key route (flag evaluation, tracking) as the user who created it; its `scopes` do not narrow that. The one exception is the server-side SDK routes (`GET /api/v1/sdk/ruleset`, `POST /api/v1/tracking/evaluations`, `POST /api/v1/tracking/assign/batch`), which require the `sdk:ruleset` scope.

Create an API key via `POST /api/v1/api-keys` with a name. The full key value is shown only once at creation time — store it securely. To use it, pass the key in the `X-API-Key: <key>` header on all SDK requests.

Keys can be listed (without exposing the secret) and revoked at any time. See [API Key Management](../security/api-keys.md) for best practices.
