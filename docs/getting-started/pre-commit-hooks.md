# Pre-commit Hooks

`.pre-commit-config.yaml` is **already in the repository root**. You do not
create it — you install it.

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

That is the whole setup. To run the hooks over the tree without committing:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## What actually runs

Two groups. The config is short on purpose, and the file itself is the
authority — read it rather than this page if the two ever disagree.

### File hygiene (`pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks`)

| hook | note |
|---|---|
| `check-yaml` | |
| `check-json` | excludes `tsconfig*.json` — those are JSONC, and a strict JSON parser is wrong about them |
| `check-added-large-files` | `--maxkb=1024`. The two OpenAPI snapshots under `docs/api/` are the only files past the default 500 KB, and they are generated text that a snapshot test diffs operation by operation — they are supposed to be large |
| `check-merge-conflict` | |
| `debug-statements` | |
| `detect-private-key` | |
| `check-toml` | |
| `check-case-conflict` | |

### Python lint and format (`astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit`)

`ruff --fix` and `ruff-format`, both scoped to `^(backend|modules|scripts)/` —
the same three trees as `make lint` and the `lint` CI job. Scoped to
`^backend/` the hook used to let a `modules/` or `scripts/` change through and
the gate then failed on it.

Ruff replaced black, isort and flake8. One tool, one config block
(`[tool.ruff]` in `pyproject.toml`). `.flake8` does not exist.

**Keep the versions in step.** The hook's `rev:` and the `ruff==` pin in
`backend/requirements.txt` must match, or a commit that passes locally fails
in CI on a formatting difference:

```bash
grep -A1 ruff-pre-commit .pre-commit-config.yaml | grep rev   # the hook
grep '^ruff==' backend/requirements.txt                       # CI and the venv
ruff --version                                                # what you have
```

## This is a subset of the gate, not the gate

Pre-commit runs **no frontend checks** — no eslint, no `tsc`, no Prettier
(there is no Prettier in this repository). It runs no mypy, no Bandit, no
Semgrep. Those live in `make lint` and in CI.

So a clean `git commit` is not a green pull request. Before pushing:

```bash
make lint     # ruff, import-linter, reuse, the lock checks, eslint, tsc,
              # hadolint, actionlint — exactly what the `lint` job runs
```

`main` requires 20 checks to merge; `lint` is one of them. See
[Development Guidelines](../development/guidelines.md) for the full list.

## Tips

Bypassing the hooks is `git commit --no-verify`. It only defers the failure to
CI, where it costs a round trip instead of a second.

`pre-commit autoupdate` bumps every `rev:`. Run `make lint` afterwards and
update the matching pin in `backend/requirements.txt` in the same commit — an
autoupdate that moves ruff on its own is precisely the version skew described
above.
