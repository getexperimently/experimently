# Multi-Armed Bandit

Multi-armed bandit (MAB) experiments dynamically reallocate traffic toward better-performing variants as data accumulates, rather than maintaining fixed allocations throughout the experiment. This maximizes reward during the experiment itself at the cost of some statistical power.

## A/B Test vs. Bandit — When to Use Which

| Scenario | Use A/B Test | Use Bandit |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Need unbiased causal estimates for a permanent change | ✅ | ❌ |
| Regulatory or compliance reporting | ✅ | ❌ |
| Short-lived promotions where maximizing conversions matters | ❌ | ✅ |
| Content recommendation / personalization | ❌ | ✅ |
| Rapidly iterating with many variants | ❌ | ✅ |
| Statistical power and precise effect sizes required | ✅ | ❌ |

## Algorithms

### Thompson Sampling (Default)

Maintains a Beta distribution for each variant based on its observed successes and total pulls. At each assignment, samples from each distribution and routes the user to the variant with the highest sample. Naturally balances exploration and exploitation.

Best for: most MAB use cases, especially when you want smooth convergence.

### UCB1 (Upper Confidence Bound)

Selects the variant with the highest upper confidence bound: `mean + sqrt(2 * ln(total_pulls) / variant_pulls)`. Explores variants with high uncertainty (few pulls) while exploiting high-performing ones.

Best for: situations where you want a deterministic, easily auditable algorithm.

### Epsilon-Greedy

With probability `epsilon`, selects a random variant (exploration). Otherwise selects the current best variant (exploitation). Simple and fast.

Best for: high-volume, low-latency scenarios where simplicity matters.

## Creating a MAB Experiment

Run the commands on this page in one terminal, in order, against the stack from the
[Quick Start](../getting-started/quick-start.md). Each uses the shell variables set by the
ones before it. Log in first; creating an experiment takes the DEVELOPER or ADMIN role:

```{.bash exec}
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"admin@demo.com","password":"Demo1234!"}' | jq -r .access_token)

curl -s localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/me -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq .role
```
<!-- expect: "ADMIN" -->

It prints `"ADMIN"`.

Set `optimization_type` to one of `thompson_sampling`, `ucb1` or `epsilon_greedy` when you
create the experiment. Everything else (variants, metrics, targeting) works as for a standard
A/B experiment. The bandit counts a conversion as an event matching the experiment's primary
metric. The collection URL ends with a slash, `/api/v1/experiments/`; without it the API
answers `307`, which `curl` doesn't follow. This saves the experiment's id in `$EXP_ID`:

```{.bash exec}
EXP=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/experiments/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "CTA Button Bandit",
    "optimization_type": "thompson_sampling",
    "variants": [
      {"name": "control", "is_control": true, "traffic_allocation": 34},
      {"name": "red_button", "traffic_allocation": 33},
      {"name": "green_button", "traffic_allocation": 33}
    ],
    "metrics": [
      {"name": "CTA click", "event_name": "cta_click", "is_primary": true}
    ]
  }')
EXP_ID=$(jq -r .id <<<"$EXP")

jq '{name, status}' <<<"$EXP"
```
<!-- expect: "name": "CTA Button Bandit" -->
<!-- expect: "status": "draft" -->

The experiment is created in `draft`. Variants' `traffic_allocation`s are whole percentages
that add up to 100; they decide the split until the bandit's first weight update.

**The experiment's own response reports `"optimization_type": "fixed"`** in this release,
whatever you created it with
([#197](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/197)). The algorithm is
stored correctly: read it from the bandit endpoint below.

## API Reference

### GET /api/v1/bandit/{experiment_id}

Returns the current bandit state: the algorithm, and each variant's weight, pulls,
successes and conversion rate. Any logged-in user can read it. This also saves each
variant's id, for the weight override further down:

```{.bash exec}
STATUS=$(curl -s localhost:8000/api/v1/bandit/$EXP_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN")
CONTROL_ID=$(jq -r '.current_weights[] | select(.variant_name == "control") | .variant_id' <<<"$STATUS")
RED_ID=$(jq -r '.current_weights[] | select(.variant_name == "red_button") | .variant_id' <<<"$STATUS")
GREEN_ID=$(jq -r '.current_weights[] | select(.variant_name == "green_button") | .variant_id' <<<"$STATUS")

jq '{algorithm, total_pulls, recommendation}' <<<"$STATUS"
```
<!-- expect: "algorithm": "thompson_sampling" -->
<!-- expect: "total_pulls": 0 -->
<!-- expect: "recommendation": "EXPLORING" -->

```json
{
  "algorithm": "thompson_sampling",
  "total_pulls": 0,
  "recommendation": "EXPLORING"
}
```

Before any update has run, every variant has an equal weight. With traffic, a response
looks like this:

```json
{
  "experiment_id": "0bdda20f-2cd5-4e99-8ba0-0ce5fc378761",
  "algorithm": "thompson_sampling",
  "current_weights": [
    {
      "variant_id": "104a0022-083b-4e22-a793-096788bbe49b",
      "variant_name": "control",
      "current_weight": 0.18,
      "successes": 820,
      "pulls": 2246,
      "conversion_rate": 0.365
    },
    {
      "variant_id": "1f1f863f-38ae-49c9-b995-60290d58def3",
      "variant_name": "red_button",
      "current_weight": 0.61,
      "successes": 3890,
      "pulls": 6382,
      "conversion_rate": 0.61
    },
    {
      "variant_id": "6f07b272-cbcc-47f9-8336-c2b58992949a",
      "variant_name": "green_button",
      "current_weight": 0.21,
      "successes": 1240,
      "pulls": 3852,
      "conversion_rate": 0.322
    }
  ],
  "total_pulls": 12480,
  "regret_reduction_pct": 2.1,
  "recommendation": "CONVERGING",
  "last_updated": "2026-09-26T14:32:00+00:00",
  "seed": 6346510783624545786,
  "n_samples": 10000,
  "engine_version": "1.0.0"
}
```

**Response Fields**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `algorithm` | The experiment's `optimization_type` |
| `current_weight` | Current traffic allocation fraction (0–1, sums to 1.0 across variants) |
| `pulls` | Total assignments to this variant |
| `successes` | Conversion events recorded for this variant |
| `regret_reduction_pct` | Estimated regret reduction compared with a uniform split; `null` until there is data |
| `recommendation` | `EXPLORING`, `CONVERGING`, or `DEPLOYING_<variant name>` once one variant dominates |
| `last_updated` | When the weights were last computed; `null` before the first update |
| `seed`, `n_samples` | The random seed and draws per variant of the last Thompson-sampling update; `null` for the other algorithms |

An experiment whose `optimization_type` is `fixed` answers `404` here.

### POST /api/v1/bandit/{experiment_id}/update

Recalculates the weights now, outside the scheduler cycle. Requires the DEVELOPER or ADMIN
role:

```{.bash exec}
curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/bandit/$EXP_ID/update \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '{algorithm, n_samples}'
```
<!-- expect: "n_samples": 10000 -->

It returns the new state, which now has a `last_updated` time. Thompson sampling draws
`n_samples` (10000) samples per variant, so with no data yet the weights move a little away
from equal at random.

---

### PUT /api/v1/bandit/{experiment_id}/weights

Overrides the variant weights. Requires the ADMIN role. The body maps each variant's id to
its weight; the weights must be at least 0 and add up to 1.0, or the API answers `422`.
Use with caution: the scheduler replaces an override on its next cycle while the experiment
is active.

```{.bash exec}
curl -s -X PUT localhost:8000/api/v1/bandit/$EXP_ID/weights \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d "{
    \"weights\": {
      \"$CONTROL_ID\": 0.1,
      \"$RED_ID\": 0.8,
      \"$GREEN_ID\": 0.1
    }
  }" | jq -c '[.current_weights[] | {variant_name, current_weight}]'
```
<!-- expect: {"variant_name":"red_button","current_weight":0.8} -->

It prints the new weights:

```json
[{"variant_name":"control","current_weight":0.1},{"variant_name":"red_button","current_weight":0.8},{"variant_name":"green_button","current_weight":0.1}]
```

---

## Scheduler

The bandit scheduler (`BanditSchedulerRunner` in `backend/app/core/bandit_scheduler.py`) starts with the API
process and recalculates weights for every ACTIVE experiment whose `optimization_type` is not `fixed`.
The cadence is `BANDIT_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default 5). It does not run under `APP_ENV=test`.

### Where the counts come from

For each variant the scheduler needs pulls (assignments) and successes (conversions). Sources are tried in order:

1. **DynamoDB real-time counters** (`get_experiment_counters`), when the counters stack is deployed.
2. **PostgreSQL**: pulls = `assignments` rows per variant; successes = distinct users with an event whose
   `event_name` matches the experiment's primary metric (see the event-matching rule in the tracking API docs).
   This is the path used in local and single-region deployments.
3. The previously persisted `BanditState`.
4. Zero-count priors (equal weights).

### How the weights affect traffic

`POST /api/v1/tracking/assign` reads the latest `BanditState` for bandit experiments and routes **new** users
according to the current weights (a deterministic hash of the user id is looked up in the cumulative weight
distribution, so repeated calls agree before the assignment row exists). Users who already have an assignment
keep it. Variants whose weight is `0` receive no new traffic. Until the first refresh has run, new users are
split by the variants' `traffic_allocation`.

`POST /api/v1/bandit/{experiment_id}/update` forces an immediate refresh from the dashboard.
