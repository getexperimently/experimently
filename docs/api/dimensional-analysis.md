# Dimensional Analysis & Segment Breakdown (Issue #28)

Dimensional analysis breaks experiment results down by user segments (e.g., by device, country, plan tier, browser) to reveal heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) — cases where the treatment works differently for different groups.

---

## Overview

When you run an experiment, the top-level result shows the average effect across all users. Dimensional analysis answers: **"Did the effect differ by segment?"**

This is useful for:
- Discovering that a feature performs well for mobile users but poorly for desktop
- Identifying segments where the treatment has a negative effect (safety check)
- Informing rollout decisions (e.g., roll out to the winning segment first)

---

## Statistical Approach

### Bonferroni Correction

When testing multiple segments simultaneously, running standard p-value tests at `α = 0.05` per segment inflates the overall false positive rate. The service applies **Bonferroni correction**:

```text
adjusted_alpha = base_alpha / num_segments
```

For example, testing 10 segments at `α = 0.05` gives an adjusted threshold of `α = 0.005` per segment.

All segment results are marked `is_exploratory: true` — they should be treated as hypothesis-generating, not confirmatory. A significant segment finding should be validated with a dedicated follow-up experiment.

### HTE Detection

Heterogeneous treatment effect detection flags cases where the treatment effect differs significantly across segments. This uses a chi-squared test on the segment-level effect estimates.

## Where the segments come from

A segment is a value of a key in the events' `metadata`. Send the dimension with the
events you track, as in `"metadata": {"device": "mobile"}`, and the breakdown groups the
experiment's users by it. A user whose events don't carry the key is counted under the
segment `unknown`.

Run the commands on this page in one terminal, in order, against the stack from the
[Quick Start](../getting-started/quick-start.md). Each uses the shell variables set by the
ones before it. Log in first:

```{.bash exec}
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"admin@demo.com","password":"Demo1234!"}' | jq -r .access_token)

curl -s localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/me -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq .role
```
<!-- expect: "ADMIN" -->

It prints `"ADMIN"`. The examples use the demo data's `checkout_button_color` experiment,
whose primary metric counts `checkout_completed` events. Its demo events carry no
metadata, so this page tracks a few that do. That takes an API key, which this saves in
`$KEY`, with the experiment's id in `$EXP_ID`. The collection URL ends with a slash,
`/api/v1/experiments/`; without it the API answers `307`, which `curl` doesn't follow:

```{.bash exec}
KEY=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "Segment demo"}' | jq -r .key)
EXP_ID=$(curl -s localhost:8000/api/v1/experiments/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq -r '.items[] | select(.key == "checkout_button_color") | .id')

echo "${KEY:0:5}"
```
<!-- expect: eptk_ -->

It prints `eptk_`, the start of every API key. This assigns eight users to the
experiment:

```{.bash exec}
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8; do
  curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/tracking/assign \
    -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"experiment_key": "checkout_button_color", "user_id": "segment-user-'"$i"'"}' \
    | jq -r .assigned
done | sort | uniq -c
```
<!-- expect: 8 true -->

It prints `8 true`: all eight were enrolled. Then each completes a checkout, the odd
numbers on `desktop` and the even ones on `mobile`. `jq` builds the batch of eight events:

```{.bash exec}
jq -n '{events: [range(1; 9) | {
  event_type: "checkout_completed",
  user_id: "segment-user-\(.)",
  experiment_key: "checkout_button_color",
  metadata: {device: (if . % 2 == 0 then "mobile" else "desktop" end)}
}]}' \
  | curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/tracking/batch \
    -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d @- | jq .success_count
```
<!-- expect: 8 -->

It prints `8`.

## API Reference

### GET /api/v1/results/{experiment_id}?breakdown={dimension}

The experiment's results, with a `breakdown` field that splits the primary metric by one
dimension, with the Bonferroni-corrected significance test above. Without `breakdown`, the
field is `null`. Any logged-in user can read it.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `breakdown` | string | ✅ | The metadata key to break down by (e.g. `device`, `country`, `plan`) |
| `confidence_level` | float | ❌ | 0.80–0.99, default `0.95` |

```{.bash exec}
curl -s "localhost:8000/api/v1/results/$EXP_ID?breakdown=device" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq '.breakdown | {dimension, is_exploratory, adjusted_alpha, segments: [.segments[].segment_value]}'
```
<!-- expect: "dimension": "device" -->
<!-- expect: "is_exploratory": true -->
<!-- expect: "desktop" -->
<!-- expect: "mobile" -->

It prints the dimension, `"is_exploratory": true`, the corrected threshold and the
segments: `desktop`, `mobile`, and `unknown` for the users' assignment events, which carry
no `device`. With three segments the threshold is 0.05 / 3, about `0.0167`.

Every segment lists every variant of the experiment by name, with zero counts where the
segment has none of its users, and `is_control` is the flag the experiment gives the
variant. The control comes first:

```{.bash exec}
curl -s "localhost:8000/api/v1/results/$EXP_ID?breakdown=device" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq -c '.breakdown.segments[] | select(.segment_value == "desktop") | [.variants[] | {variant_name, is_control}]'
```
<!-- expect: [{"variant_name":"blue_button","is_control":true},{"variant_name":"green_button","is_control":false}] -->

It prints `blue_button`, the control, then `green_button`. One segment in full:

```json
{
  "segment_value": "desktop",
  "sample_size": 4,
  "variants": [
    {
      "variant_id": "34852c9e-05db-4168-b164-d1e8332503d5",
      "variant_name": "blue_button",
      "is_control": true,
      "sample_size": 1,
      "conversions": 1,
      "mean": 1.0,
      "confidence_interval": [0.1486, 1.0],
      "p_value": null,
      "is_significant": false
    },
    {
      "variant_id": "f180194d-b5d7-40bc-abd8-a6b155772845",
      "variant_name": "green_button",
      "is_control": false,
      "sample_size": 3,
      "conversions": 3,
      "mean": 1.0,
      "confidence_interval": [0.3436, 1.0],
      "p_value": 1.0,
      "is_significant": false
    }
  ]
}
```

The control's `p_value` is `null`; every other variant's is its test against the control in
the same segment. The breakdown also carries `has_heterogeneous_effects` and `hte_warning`.

### GET /api/v1/experiments/{experiment_id}/segmented-results/{segment_by}

Counts per segment, variant and metric, with no significance test. Only segments with the
key are listed (no `unknown`), `conversion_rate` is a percentage, and an experiment in
`draft` answers `400`. `metric_id` narrows it to one metric:

```{.bash exec}
curl -s localhost:8000/api/v1/experiments/$EXP_ID/segmented-results/device \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq '[.segments[] | {segment_value, variants: [.metrics[0].variants[] | {variant_name, sample_size, conversions}]}]'
```
<!-- expect: "segment_value": "desktop" -->
<!-- expect: "variant_name": "blue_button" -->
<!-- expect: "segment_value": "mobile" -->

It prints the `desktop` and `mobile` segments, each with the users and conversions of
`blue_button` and `green_button`.

## Reading the Results

1. **`adjusted_alpha`** is the per-segment significance threshold after Bonferroni correction. A segment is `is_significant: true` only if its p-value is below this threshold.

2. **`is_exploratory: true`** on all segments means treat findings as signals, not conclusions. Run a dedicated follow-up experiment to confirm.

3. **Segments with small sample sizes** (< ~200 per variant) will rarely show significance even with large effects. The p-values are still valid but the confidence intervals will be wide.

| `device` | `mobile`, `desktop`, `tablet` |
| `country` | `US`, `GB`, `DE` |
| `plan` | `free`, `pro`, `enterprise` |
| `browser` | `chrome`, `safari`, `firefox` |
| `new_user` | `true`, `false` |
