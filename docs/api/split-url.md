# Server-Side Split URL Testing API

!!! info "Part of the `split_url` module"
    Split URL testing is one of the optional modules -- present in the **full profile**, absent from the core one. A core deployment does not serve these routes. See [Modules and profiles](../getting-started/modules.md) for what each profile includes and how to run the full one.

!!! warning "The edge router does not split traffic in this release"
    The Lambda@Edge router reads its configuration only from an `X-Split-URL-Config` request
    header, and nothing sets that header: no stack creates the CloudFront distribution or adds
    the header, and the platform does not send an experiment's `split_url_config` to the edge.
    Without it the router passes every request through unchanged, so deploying the construct
    does not split traffic. What works today is storing a split URL experiment and its
    configuration, and the preview endpoint. The preview does not predict the router either:
    it hashes the `user_id` you pass with the experiment's id, while the router hashes the
    viewer's IP address and User-Agent with the `experiment_key` in its configuration
    ([#393](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/393)).

This document describes the server-side split URL testing feature. Split URL experiments are meant to redirect different users to distinct URLs (e.g., `/checkout` vs `/checkout-v2`) at the CloudFront layer, with a Lambda@Edge router and a cookie that keeps each viewer on one variant.

---

## Overview

Split URL testing differs from classic A/B tests in that the **entire page or URL path** varies between variants rather than a component within a single page. Given a configuration, the router (`modules/lambda/split_url_router/handler.py`):

1. Reads the viewer's assignment cookie (`split_url_{experiment_key}` unless the configuration names another).
2. If the cookie holds one of the variant URLs, passes the request through.
3. Otherwise hashes the viewer's IP address and User-Agent to pick a variant.
4. Answers `302` to that variant's URL, with a cookie that lasts 30 days unless the configuration sets `cookie_ttl_days`.

---

## Experiment Type

Set `experiment_type` to `split_url` when creating an experiment.

### `SplitUrlConfig` Schema

`split_url_config` holds the URL variants:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `variants` | `array` | Yes | The URL variants: at least 2 |
| `variants[].name` | `string` | Yes | The variant's name |
| `variants[].url` | `string` | Yes | The URL this variant is sent to (stored as given; not checked) |
| `variants[].traffic_allocation` | `number` | Yes | Percentage of traffic, 0-100; the values must sum to 100 |
| `cookie_name` | `string` | No | The router's cookie name; `null` means `split_url_{experiment_key}` |
| `cookie_ttl_days` | `int` | No | How long the router's cookie lasts, in days (default `30`) |
| `canonical_url` | `string` | No | Stored with the configuration; nothing reads it yet |

The first URL variant is the router's control, which a holdout sends its viewers to.

## Create a Split URL Experiment

```
POST /api/v1/experiments/
```

**Example Request**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-platform.example.com/api/v1/experiments/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Checkout Flow Split URL Test",
    "hypothesis": "The new checkout URL reduces drop-off by 10%",
    "experiment_type": "split_url",
    "variants": [
      { "name": "Control",   "is_control": true,  "traffic_allocation": 50 },
      { "name": "Treatment", "is_control": false, "traffic_allocation": 50 }
    ],
    "metrics": [
      { "name": "Purchase", "event_name": "purchase", "metric_type": "conversion", "is_primary": true }
    ],
    "split_url_config": {
      "variants": [
        { "name": "Control",   "url": "https://example.com/checkout",    "traffic_allocation": 50 },
        { "name": "Treatment", "url": "https://example.com/checkout-v2", "traffic_allocation": 50 }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

**Response: 201 Created** (abridged: the response is the whole experiment)

```json
{
  "id": "acf727d0-fd25-41d6-9813-7335d9ad189f",
  "name": "Checkout Flow Split URL Test",
  "experiment_type": "split_url",
  "status": "draft",
  "split_url_config": {
    "variants": [
      { "url": "https://example.com/checkout",    "name": "Control",   "traffic_allocation": 50.0 },
      { "url": "https://example.com/checkout-v2", "name": "Treatment", "traffic_allocation": 50.0 }
    ],
    "cookie_name": null,
    "canonical_url": null,
    "cookie_ttl_days": 30
  }
}
```

---

## Split URL Preview Endpoint

```
GET /api/v1/experiments/{experiment_id}/split-url/preview
```

Returns the URL variant the preview's own hash gives a `user_id`, without redirecting. It hashes
`{user_id}:{experiment_id}`, so it does not tell you what the router would do for a viewer (see
the note at the top of this page). It is for ADMIN and DEVELOPER users (and superusers), and in
a core deployment it answers `501`.

**Path Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `experiment_id` | `string` (UUID) | The experiment to preview |

**Query Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `user_id` | `string` | Yes | User identifier to hash |

**Example Request**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-platform.example.com/api/v1/experiments/acf727d0-fd25-41d6-9813-7335d9ad189f/split-url/preview?user_id=alice" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token"
```

**Response: 200 OK**

```json
{
  "experiment_id": "acf727d0-fd25-41d6-9813-7335d9ad189f",
  "user_id": "alice",
  "variant_name": "Treatment",
  "url": "https://example.com/checkout-v2",
  "traffic_allocation": 50.0
}
```

## Lambda@Edge Cookie and Redirect Flow

This is what the router does once a request carries its configuration header. Nothing adds
that header in this release (see the note at the top of this page).

```
Viewer request
     |
     v
Lambda@Edge (viewer-request)
     |
     +-- No X-Split-URL-Config header, invalid JSON or fewer than 2 variants --> pass through
     |
     +-- Read cookie: split_url_{experiment_key} (or cookie_name)
     |        |
     |        +-- Holds one of the variant URLs --> pass through
     |        |
     |        +-- Absent or unknown --> hash IP + User-Agent + experiment_key
     |                                   --> pick a variant (or the first, in a holdout)
     |
     +-- Return 302 with:
           Location: <variant url>
           Set-Cookie: split_url_{experiment_key}=<variant url>; Max-Age=<cookie_ttl_days x 86400>; Path=/; SameSite=Lax
           X-Split-URL-Variant: <variant name>
           Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache
```

The header's JSON carries `experiment_key`, `variants` (each with `name`, `url` and
`traffic_allocation`), and optionally `cookie_name`, `cookie_ttl_days` and `holdout_percentage`.

### Cookie Details

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Cookie name** | `cookie_name`, or `split_url_{experiment_key}` |
| **Cookie value** | The assigned variant's URL |
| **Max-Age** | `cookie_ttl_days` × 86,400 seconds: 2,592,000 (30 days) by default |
| **Path** | `/` |
| **Secure** | Not set by the router |
| **SameSite** | `Lax` |

### Redirect Details

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **HTTP status** | `302 Found` |
| **Location header** | The assigned variant's `url` |
| **X-Split-URL-Variant** | The assigned variant's `name` |
| **Cache-Control** | `no-store, no-cache` |

### Cookie Persistence

A browser keeps the cookie for its Max-Age, 30 days by default. While the cookie holds one of
the variant URLs, the router passes that viewer's requests through without hashing again; a
cookie naming a URL that is no longer a variant is treated as no cookie.

## CloudFront CDK Construct

> Split URL testing is a **module**, not part of the core profile. The
> construct and the Lambda@Edge handler live under `modules/`, so a core
> checkout does not have them. See [Modules & Profiles](../getting-started/modules.md).

`modules/infrastructure/constructs/split_url_distribution.py` provisions a
CloudFront distribution wired to a Lambda@Edge viewer-request function. No stack
in this repository uses it:

1. **No caching** (TTL 0) — every request must reach the router, or a user
   would be served another user's variant from the edge cache.
2. **HTTPS-only** viewer protocol policy, so the assignment cookie is not sent
   in clear text.
3. **`ALL_VIEWER` origin request policy** (`OriginRequestPolicy.ALL_VIEWER`), so a
   request the router lets through reaches the origin with every viewer header, cookie
   and query string. (`ALLOW_ALL` is a different setting, the allowed methods: GET, HEAD,
   OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST and DELETE.)

The CDK app is **Python** (`infrastructure/cdk/app.py`; `cdk.json` runs
`python3 app.py`). There is no TypeScript in this repository's infrastructure.

```python
from modules.infrastructure.constructs.split_url_distribution import (
    SplitUrlDistribution,
)

split_url = SplitUrlDistribution(
    self,
    "CheckoutSplitUrl",
    router_function=router_fn,        # lambda_.IFunction, in us-east-1
    origin_domain=alb.load_balancer_dns_name,
)
# split_url.distribution  -> the CloudFront Distribution
# split_url.domain_name   -> e.g. d1234.cloudfront.net
```

**How the router gets its configuration.** Only from the `X-Split-URL-Config`
request header, and neither the construct nor anything else sets it. The handler
(`modules/lambda/split_url_router/handler.py`) passes the request through unchanged
when the header is missing, invalid, or names fewer than two variants. Assignment
hashes a client fingerprint (IP + User-Agent), so it makes no call back to the
platform.

---

## Validation Rules

On create, `split_url_config` is checked for:

- at least 2 URL variants;
- `traffic_allocation` values that sum to 100 (within 0.01), none of them NaN or infinite.

Nothing else about it is checked: the URLs are stored as given, the number of URL variants
need not match the experiment's variants, and an experiment of another type can carry a
configuration, as a `split_url` experiment can be created without one (its preview then
answers `400`).

|---|---|
| `400 Bad Request` | Preview: the experiment is not a `split_url` experiment, or has no `split_url_config` |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid Bearer token |
| `403 Forbidden` | Preview: the user is not ADMIN, DEVELOPER or a superuser |
| `404 Not Found` | Preview: no experiment has this id |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` | Create: the body fails validation, such as allocations that do not sum to 100 |
| `501 Not Implemented` | Preview, or creating a `split_url` experiment, in a core deployment |
