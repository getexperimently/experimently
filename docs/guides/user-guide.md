## Experiments

### What Is an A/B Test?

An A/B test (experiment) splits your users into groups, shows each group a different version of a feature, and measures which version performs better on a defined metric.

**Key concepts:**
- **Control** — the current/existing experience (your baseline)
- **Treatment/Variant** — the new experience you're testing
- **Metric** — what you're measuring (conversion rate, revenue, clicks)
- **Statistical significance** — confidence that the difference is real, not random noise

### Creating an Experiment

**Experiments → + New Experiment** opens *guided setup*, five short steps. Your answers
stay in this browser tab until you press **Create Experiment**; reloading starts over.
If you prefer every field on one page, choose **Use the single-page form (advanced)** —
your answers carry over.

**Step 1: Type**

Choose **A/B Test** or **Multivariate**. Split URL and bandit experiments need settings
guided setup does not ask for; create those through the API or an SDK.

**Step 2: Details**

- **Name**: Descriptive name, e.g., "Homepage CTA Button Color Q1 2026"
- **Key**: generated from the name until you edit it, e.g., `homepage_cta_button_color_q1_2026` — your code passes this as `experiment_key`
- **Description**: Background context, links to design doc, Jira ticket
- **Hypothesis**: "Changing the CTA button from blue to green will increase click-through rate by 10%"

Then choose what to measure. Mark one metric as the **primary metric** (the one you decide
on); any others are tracked alongside it.

| Metric Type | When to Use | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **CONVERSION** | Binary outcome (did it happen?) | Clicked CTA, completed checkout, signed up |
| **REVENUE** | Dollar amounts | Order value, LTV increase |
| **COUNT** | How many times | Page views per session, actions taken |
| **DURATION** | Time measurements | Session duration, time to first action |

The metric's **event name** must match exactly what your engineers track in code (e.g., `checkout_complete`).

**Step 3: Variants**

Every experiment needs a control; mark one variant as it:

| Variant | Is Control | Traffic % |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Control (Blue Button) | ✅ | 50% |
| Treatment (Green Button) | — | 50% |

The traffic split must add up to exactly 100%.

For multivariate tests, add more variants:

| Variant | Is Control | Traffic % |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Control | ✅ | 34% |
| Green Button | — | 33% |
| Red Button | — | 33% |

Only want to test on specific users? Add targeting rules on the same step:

- Country is in [US, CA]
- Subscription plan is "premium"
- Account age is greater than 30 days

Users who don't match targeting rules are excluded from the experiment entirely.

Every condition needs an attribute, an operator and (for most operators) a value. If one is
missing, **Create Experiment** stops and the problem is shown beside the targeting rules; a
condition the server cannot apply is reported there too.

**Step 4: How results will be judged, and an estimate**

First, **How results will be judged**. These two settings are saved with the experiment and
cannot be changed after it starts:

- **Confidence level**: 90%, 95% (recommended) or 99%. At 95%, a variant is significant when
  its p-value is below 0.05.
- **Correction for several variants**: Benjamini-Hochberg (recommended), Bonferroni (stricter)
  or None. It only matters with three or more variants: each extra variant is another chance
  for one to look like a winner by luck. Benjamini-Hochberg keeps the share of false winners
  among the variants called significant at about 5% (at 95% confidence); Bonferroni keeps the
  chance of even one false winner at 5% and needs more users. The correction applies to the
  variants of each metric, not across metrics.

The single-page form has the same two settings in a collapsed **Analysis settings** section,
whose title shows the current values.

Then, optionally, the estimate. Enter your baseline conversion rate and the smallest change
worth detecting — a *relative* change, so 5% on a 12% baseline means 12% → 12.6% — and press
**Calculate estimate**. At 80% power and 95% confidence that example needs 47,036 users per
variant. Add your daily users to see roughly how many days that takes. The estimate is
advisory and is not saved. It plans each comparison at 1 − the confidence level and makes no
correction for comparing several variants, so with three or more variants and a correction
the experiment needs more users than it says.

**Step 5: Review and create**

Check the summary, including the **Analysis** row (for example "95% confidence ·
Benjamini-Hochberg correction"), use **Edit** to go back to any step, then press **Create
Experiment**.
The experiment is created as a draft and you land on its page.

**Then: start the experiment**

Click **Start** on the experiment's page. The status changes to `ACTIVE`.

You can also schedule automatic start and end dates. The dashboard has no schedule
screen yet, so this is an API call: `PUT /api/v1/experiments/{experiment_id}/schedule`,
on a `DRAFT` experiment, with an ADMIN or DEVELOPER token. The experiment activates at
`start_date` and completes at `end_date`, which must be at least an hour later. A date you
leave out of the request is left as it is, and `null` clears it. A date written without a
UTC offset is read in `time_zone`, an IANA name such as `America/Los_Angeles` (default
`UTC`); a date with an offset, like the ones below, keeps it. Dates are stored in UTC.

```{.bash skip reason="server: needs a running API, a signed-in token in TOKEN and a draft experiment's id in EXPERIMENT_ID"}
curl -s -X PUT "localhost:8000/api/v1/experiments/$EXPERIMENT_ID/schedule" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"start_date": "2026-11-02T09:00:00Z", "end_date": "2026-11-16T09:00:00Z"}'
```

---

### Pausing and Stopping

**Pause**: Temporarily halt assignment of new users. Existing assignments are preserved. Use when you need to investigate anomalies or if there's a critical bug.

A paused experiment stays paused until you click **Start** again. Nothing resumes it
behind your back: not the scheduler, and not a restart of the service.

To have it resume by itself at a set time, schedule a resume *after* pausing: the same
`PUT /api/v1/experiments/{experiment_id}/schedule` call, where `start_date` is the time
to resume at. It is stored as `resume_at` (returned with the experiment); the experiment's own
start date does not move. On a paused experiment:

- `"start_date": null` cancels a scheduled resume;
- a field you leave out is left as it is, as on a draft;
- `end_date` must be later than the experiment's start date and, with a resume scheduled,
  at least an hour after the resume time.

Starting, completing or archiving the experiment cancels a scheduled resume, and so does
any other change of status.

**Complete**: Stop the experiment. Use when you have sufficient data and are ready to make a decision. Existing data is preserved.

**Rules for stopping early:**
- You need statistical significance (p-value < 0.05) AND practical significance (effect size is meaningful)
- Resist the urge to stop as soon as significance is reached — this inflates false positive rates
- Use the **Sample Size** tab to confirm the smallest variant has reached the planned sample before deciding

---

### Reading Results

Navigate to **Experiments → [Your Experiment] → Results** or http://localhost:3000/results/EXPERIMENT_ID.

#### Experiment Summary Card

Shows at a glance:
- **Status**: Active / Completed
- **Duration**: Days running
- **Total Users**: Participants across all variants
- **Minimum sample**: *Reached* when every variant has at least the primary metric's
  minimum sample size (100 users unless the metric sets another), otherwise *Not reached*.
  A variant is recommended for shipping only once this is reached. It is a floor, not the
  planned sample size: the **Sample Size** tab shows that, and the card's "See the Sample
  Size tab for the planned sample." link opens it.
- **Recommendation**: SHIP VARIANT / KEEP CONTROL / CONTINUE TESTING / INCONCLUSIVE
- **Analysis**: the confidence level and correction the results use, which are the
  experiment's own settings. For example "95% confidence · Benjamini-Hochberg correction for
  the 2 comparisons with the control on each metric", or, with one treatment, "one comparison
  with the control on each metric, so no correction is needed".

For an experiment with several variants and a correction, a note says that since v0.19 its
results use the experiment's correction, and that earlier versions showed them uncorrected, so
a variant marked significant then may not be significant now. To see the uncorrected numbers,
ask the API with `?correction_method=none` (`GET /api/v1/results/{experiment_id}`).

#### Sample Ratio Check

The results page compares how many users each variant received with its traffic allocation (a
chi-square test of the assignment counts). If they differ by more than chance allows
(p < 0.001), a notice above the tabs says so, with each variant's users and the number expected.
The recommendation is then **INCONCLUSIVE**, and a "Leading" variant and the Bayesian analysis
carry a warning. A mismatch usually means assignment or tracking is broken, so do not use the
numbers for a decision until you find out why.

When the split matches, one line below the summary card says so, with the check's p-value.
Nothing is shown for a bandit, which moves traffic on purpose, for an experiment with no users
yet, or when the check could not be run; that is not a pass. The API returns the check as `srm`
in `GET /api/v1/results/{experiment_id}`.

#### Bayesian Analysis

For an experiment with Bayesian analysis on, the end of the **Overview** tab shows a Bayesian
analysis of the primary metric: its decision (*Continue*, *Stop: a winner is clear*, *Stop: the
variants are equivalent* or *Stop: a meaningful difference is unlikely*) and, for each variant,
the chance it is the best, the expected loss, the posterior mean and the credible interval. It is
a second analysis and does not change the recommendation. When Bayesian analysis is on but the
results carry none, a line says it could not be computed. The method is described in
[Bayesian analysis](../api/bayesian.md).

#### Recommendation Meanings

| Recommendation | Meaning | Action |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| **SHIP VARIANT** | Treatment is significantly better | Deploy the treatment to all users |
| **KEEP CONTROL** | Control is significantly better | Do not ship the treatment |
| **CONTINUE TESTING** | Not enough data yet | Wait for more data before deciding |
| **INCONCLUSIVE** | No meaningful difference detected | Consider whether the change is worth shipping anyway |

#### Metric Comparison Table

For each metric and variant pair:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Sample Size** | Users assigned to this variant |
| **Value** | Conversion rate or average value for this variant |
| **Improvement** | How much better/worse vs. control (e.g., +12.3%) |
| **p-value** | Probability the difference is due to chance (lower = more confident). Headed **Adjusted p-value** when a correction applies and a metric has two or more treatments with a p-value: the p-value after the experiment's correction, with the unadjusted value beneath it. A footnote under the table names the correction. |
| **Significance** | (adjusted) p-value < (1 - confidence level), e.g., < 0.05 for 95% confidence |

The table has no effect size or confidence interval column yet. Both are in the API
response: `GET /api/v1/results/{experiment_id}` returns `effect_size`, `effect_size_label`
(negligible / small / medium / large) and `confidence_interval` for each variant.

**Green** = statistically significant improvement
**Red** = statistically significant degradation
**Gray** = not statistically significant

#### Trend Chart

Shows conversion rate over time for each variant. Two modes:
- **Cumulative**: Running total from experiment start (recommended — smooths noise)
- **Daily**: Day-by-day rate (useful for detecting novelty effects or day-of-week patterns)

Look for:
- Parallel lines early → diverging lines → stable difference (healthy experiment)
- Crossing lines → potential interaction effects or bugs
- Spike on day 1 → novelty effect (users excited about newness)

#### Sample Size

The **Sample Size** tab shows the planned sample size: how many users each variant needs to
detect the smallest lift you care about, and how far the experiment has got.

**Calculated from.** Every number the plan uses is shown, with where it came from:

- **Baseline conversion rate**: the rate observed in the control variant on the primary metric
  so far ("Observed in control so far: 11.8% (2,140 users)"), or the rate you typed ("Entered by
  you"). The results are cached for up to five minutes and this tab is not, so for that long its
  rate can be newer than the one on the Overview.
- **Minimum detectable effect**: 5% relative unless you change it. Relative means 12% → 12.6%,
  not 17%. Experiments do not store a planned effect.
- **Power** (80%, 90% or 95%) and **significance** (always two-sided, which is what the
  results test): 1 − the experiment's confidence level unless you choose 5%, 1% or 10%. A level
  set through the API, such as 92%, shows as "8% (this experiment's setting)".
- **Correction**, for three or more variants: the experiment's correction unless you choose
  another. Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg plans each comparison with the control at
  significance ÷ (variants − 1).

Change any of them and press **Recalculate**. Nothing is saved and the page address does not
change, so the plan goes back to the observed rate, the defaults and the experiment's settings
when you reload.

**Progress** is the smallest variant: "Smallest variant: 20,000 of 47,036 (43%)", then either
"43% of planned sample" or "Planned sample reached". The power shown is the power to detect your
planned lift at the current size, not the effect seen so far.

The tab also says when:

- **no users have been assigned yet**, or there is no rate to plan from (no control conversions,
  or every control user converted): type the rate you expect;
- **the metric is not a conversion**: every metric is analysed as a conversion today, so the
  plan is for a conversion rate; use the Power Calculator for anything else;
- **a fixed sample size is a guide only**: a bandit, an uneven split, sequential testing or
  Bayesian analysis.

This is not the same check as **Minimum sample** on the Overview card, which is the floor the
recommendation needs.

The tab loads its numbers separately from the rest of the page. If they cannot be loaded,
the tab says so and offers **Try again**; the Overview and the other tabs still work.

---

### Making a Decision

Once your experiment is adequately powered and statistically significant:

1. **Check primary metric**: Is the direction positive? Is the effect meaningful?
2. **Check secondary metrics**: Did anything unexpected change (e.g., revenue went up but customer satisfaction dropped)?
3. **Check for novelty effect**: Did the initial spike smooth out? Are trends stable?
4. **Consult stakeholders**: Share results and the recommendation with the team

**Ship**: Deploy the winning variant to 100% of users. Mark the experiment as **Completed**.

**Keep control**: The change didn't work. Archive or redesign the hypothesis.

**Document your decision**: Add a note in the experiment description with the outcome and rationale. This creates institutional memory.

---

## Feature Flags

Feature flags let you control which users see a feature without deploying new code. They're useful for:

- **Canary releases**: Deploy to 5% of users first, monitor, then expand
- **Kill switches**: Instant rollback without a code deploy
- **Beta programs**: Enable features for specific user groups
- **Gradual rollouts**: Expand from 10% → 50% → 100% over time

### Creating a Feature Flag

Navigate to **Feature Flags → New Flag**:

- **Key**: Identifier used in code, e.g., `new-checkout-flow` (cannot change after creation)
- **Name**: Human-readable name
- **Description**: What this flag controls
- **Rollout Percentage**: Start at 0 for a disabled flag

### Controlling Rollout

**Manual rollout:**

Open the flag, move the **Rollout percentage** slider to the desired value and press **Save Changes**. Changes take effect within 60 seconds (cache TTL).

| Percentage | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| 0% | Feature disabled for all users |
| 5% | 1 in 20 users sees the feature |
| 50% | Half of users |
| 100% | All users see the feature |

**Who gets the feature?**
The platform uses a deterministic hash of the user's ID. The same user always gets the same result (sticky assignment). This means:
- If you set 5%, the same 5% of users will consistently see the feature
- If you increase to 50%, the original 5% are still included (plus 45% more)

**Adding targeting rules:**

Optionally restrict to specific users:
- Enable only for users in the US
- Only for users on the "enterprise" plan
- Only for users who signed up before a certain date

Every condition needs an attribute, an operator and (for most operators) a value. If one is
missing, **Create Feature Flag** or **Save Changes** stops and the problem is shown beside the
targeting rules; a condition the server cannot apply is reported there too.

Rules written through the API in a shape the rule builder cannot show are displayed
read-only. Saving other changes, such as the rollout percentage, leaves them as they are;
**Replace rules** starts again with the builder.

### Scheduled Rollouts

For gradual rollouts on a schedule:

The dashboard has no screen for creating a rollout schedule yet. Create it through the
API with `POST /api/v1/rollout-schedules` (the stages go in its `stages` list; see
[Rollouts](../feature-flags/rollouts.md) for the full contract), then start it with
`POST /api/v1/rollout-schedules/{schedule_id}/activate`. The flag's page in the dashboard
shows the schedule, its status and its stages, read-only. A schedule like this one:

| Stage | Target % | Trigger Type | Start Date |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Stage 1 | 5% | Time-based | Apr 1, 2026 |
| Stage 2 | 25% | Time-based | Apr 8, 2026 |
| Stage 3 | 100% | Manual | — |

The platform automatically advances time-based stages. A manual stage waits until you
advance it. The dashboard has no button for that yet, so it is an API call:
`POST /api/v1/rollout-schedules/stages/{stage_id}/advance`.

**Best practice:** End your schedule with a manual stage for the final 100% rollout. This gives you a human approval gate before full deployment.

### Disabling / Rolling Back

To instantly disable a flag, turn it off with the switch at the top of its page; it then
shows **Not serving**. Setting the rollout percentage to 0 is not the same: users matched by a
targeting rule keep the flag.

If you have safety monitoring configured, the platform can roll the flag back automatically if
error rates spike. A rollback to 0% turns the flag off for every user and pauses its rollout
schedule (see [Safety Monitoring](../feature-flags/safety.md#what-a-rollback-changes)).

### Archived Flags

An archived flag is retired and never served. It cannot be turned on until it is
unarchived: the API refuses every request that would turn it on with "This flag is
archived. Unarchive it before turning it on." Turning it off succeeds and changes
nothing. Archiving and unarchiving are API calls for now (bulk toggle with
`archive`, and `POST /api/v1/feature-flags/{id}/unarchive`, which is beta); an
unarchived flag comes back inactive. See
[Archived flags](../feature-flags/create.md#archived-flags).

---

## Analytics & Reporting

### Viewing All Experiments

**Experiments list** shows all experiments with their name, status, type, number of
variants and creation date.

Filter by status: All / Draft / Active / Paused / Completed. There is no filter by date,
owner or experiment type yet.

### Exporting Results

The Results page has no export button yet. Use the API:
- **CSV export**: `GET /api/v1/export/variants` downloads per-variant results as CSV
  (`?format=json` for JSON); see [Data Export](../api/data-export.md)
- **Full results**: `GET /api/v1/results/{experiment_id}` returns JSON with all statistics

---

## Targeting Rules Reference

### Basic Rules

```text
country IN [US, CA, GB]          → User's country is one of the list
plan EQUALS premium              → Exact match
age GREATER_THAN 18              → Numeric comparison
email CONTAINS @company.com     → String match
app_version SEMVER_GT 2.0.0     → Semantic version comparison
```

### Logical Operators

```text
AND: all rules must match
OR:  at least one rule must match
NOT: rule must NOT match
```

### Complex Example

Target US/EU premium users who are active:
```text
AND:
  country IN [US, GB, DE, FR]
  plan IN [pro, enterprise]
  days_since_last_login LESS_THAN 30
```

Target either new users OR power users (but not average users):
```text
OR:
  account_age_days LESS_THAN 7
  AND:
    lifetime_purchases GREATER_THAN 20
    plan EQUALS enterprise
```

## Best Practices

### Experiment Design

**Do:**
- Define your hypothesis and primary metric BEFORE starting the experiment
- Run the experiment for at least one full week to capture weekly patterns
- Wait for statistical significance AND adequate sample size before deciding
- Document your hypothesis, result, and decision for future reference
- Run one change at a time per experiment (isolate variables)

**Don't:**
- Stop the experiment as soon as you see significance (peeking inflates false positives)
- Change the experiment configuration after it's started
- Run too many concurrent experiments on the same users (interaction effects)
- Use the novelty effect as evidence (users are excited about newness, not the feature)

### Feature Flags

**Do:**
- Always start at 0% and ramp up gradually for risky changes
- Set up safety monitoring for flags that touch payments, auth, or core flows
- Document what the flag controls and who to contact if issues arise
- Clean up flags after full rollout — don't leave them in code forever

**Don't:**
- Jump straight to 100% for significant changes
- Leave flags enabled indefinitely — schedule cleanup
- Use flags to hide incomplete features in production without testing

### Statistical Significance

- **p-value < 0.05**: 95% confident the difference is real (not random)
- **p-value < 0.01**: 99% confident — use for high-stakes decisions
- **Always check effect size**: A p-value of 0.001 means nothing if the effect is 0.1%
- **Minimum detectable effect**: Design experiments to detect a meaningful improvement (e.g., 5%), not just any improvement

---

## Advanced Statistical Methods

### Sequential Testing — Stop Experiments Early

Standard A/B tests require a fixed sample size decided upfront. Sequential testing lets you monitor results continuously and stop as soon as you have enough evidence — without inflating your false positive rate.

**When to use it:** When you need results faster, or when you need to stop early if a variant is performing significantly worse.

Access via the **Sequential** tab on any experiment results page, or via:
```text
GET /api/v1/results/{experiment_id}/sequential
```

The platform uses **mSPRT** (mixture Sequential Probability Ratio Test). When `recommended_action` is `stop_for_effect`, it is safe to stop. An experiment running well past its expected duration is flagged `at_risk`; that is advisory, not a reason to conclude there is no effect. See the [Sequential Testing Guide](../api/sequential-testing.md) for details.

---

### CUPED — Reach Significance Faster

CUPED reduces result noise by adjusting for each user's own events in the days before they were assigned; how much depends on how well that history predicts the outcome.

**When to use it:** When your users sent the metric's event before the experiment (returning customers who bought before, say). Send that history to the tracking API with no experiment key, before you start the experiment: history the server receives after a user was assigned is ignored for that user.

The dashboard has no CUPED tab; it is available through the API:
```text
GET /api/v1/results/{experiment_id}/cuped
```

See the [CUPED Guide](../api/cuped.md) for sending history and reading the result.

---

### Dimensional Analysis — Did the Effect Vary by Segment?

After an experiment concludes, use dimensional analysis to understand whether the treatment worked differently for different groups (mobile vs desktop, new vs returning users, etc.).

**Important:** Segment findings are always exploratory. Use them to generate hypotheses for follow-up experiments, not as final conclusions.

Access via the **Breakdowns** tab on any experiment results page, or via:
```text
GET /api/v1/experiments/{experiment_id}/segmented-results/{segment_by}?dimension=device
```

See the [Dimensional Analysis Guide](../api/dimensional-analysis.md).

---

### Multi-Armed Bandit — Maximize Conversions During the Experiment

A bandit experiment automatically shifts traffic toward the better-performing variant as data accumulates. Use this when maximizing conversions during the experiment matters more than getting precise effect size estimates.

**When to use it:** Short-lived promotions, content recommendations, or situations where you have many variants to test quickly.

Set `optimization_type` to `thompson_sampling`, `ucb1`, or `epsilon_greedy` when creating an experiment. See the [Multi-Armed Bandit Guide](../api/multi-armed-bandit.md).

---

### Interaction Detection — Are Your Experiments Interfering?

When multiple experiments run simultaneously on overlapping user populations, they can distort each other's results. Run an interaction scan to find the pairs that share users, then ask the pair route whether one experiment's effect differs across the other's arms (beta). The scan measures overlap only.

Access via:
```text
GET /api/v1/interactions/scan
GET /api/v1/interactions/{exp_a_id}/{exp_b_id}
```

If high-risk pairs are found, add the experiments to a [Mutual Exclusion Group](../api/mutual-exclusion-groups.md) to prevent overlap in future runs. See the [Interaction Detection Guide](../api/interaction-detection.md).
