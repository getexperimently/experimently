# What the Dashboard Does, and What Is API Only

Everything Experimently does is in the REST API. The dashboard covers the everyday loop: create
an experiment, start it, read its results, and create, target, roll out and switch off feature
flags. Some capabilities work through the API, and through the SDKs where they apply, but have no
screen yet.

The table lists each capability and where you do it today:

- **Dashboard**: a screen in the dashboard does it.
- **API only**: it works through the API, with no screen yet. The guide in the last column shows
  the requests.

Screens for the API-only rows are planned for after launch. The open work is tracked in
[issue #442](https://github.com/getexperimently/experimently/issues/442).

!!! note "For contributors: this table is checked"
    `backend/tests/unit/docs/test_dashboard_and_api.py` gives each row a marker the screen
    carries in its markup. It fails when a row says **API only** while the dashboard has that
    screen, and when a row says **Dashboard** while the screen is missing or no page test checks
    it. A pull request that adds one of these screens changes its row to **Dashboard** in the
    same change.
