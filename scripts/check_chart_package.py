"""Fail unless a packaged Helm chart is the release it is about to be attached to.

``release.yml``'s ``chart`` job runs ``helm package charts/experimently`` and
then this, before the ``.tgz`` goes anywhere:

    python3 scripts/check_chart_package.py dist/experimently-X.Y.Z.tgz --expect X.Y.Z

It reads the ``Chart.yaml`` *inside the archive* -- what a user who downloads
the asset installs -- not the one in the tree, which ``check_version_sources.py``
has already compared with the tag. The two can differ: ``helm package`` takes
``--version`` and ``--app-version`` overrides, and it packages whatever the
checkout holds.

Checked, each exactly (image tags and chart versions are strings, not PEP 440
versions, so ``0.1.0rc1`` is not ``0.1.0-rc.1``):

* the archive holds exactly one ``Chart.yaml``, at ``experimently/Chart.yaml``;
* its ``name`` is ``experimently``;
* its ``version`` and ``appVersion`` are both the expected version -- the
  chart's default image tag is ``<profile>-<appVersion>``, so a stale
  ``appVersion`` installs the previous release's images;
* the file is called ``experimently-<version>.tgz``, the name ``helm package``
  gives it and the one the release asset is published under.

Standard library only: ``helm package`` rewrites ``Chart.yaml`` as plain
top-level ``key: value`` lines (comments dropped, strings quoted only when YAML
needs it), and the release job installs nothing to read them.
