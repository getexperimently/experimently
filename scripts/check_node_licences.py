"""Fail when the dashboard's production npm closure gains a licence we cannot ship.

The Python side of this already exists: ``scripts/core_build.sh``'s ``licences``
step checks the transitive closure of ``backend/requirements/runtime.txt``
against an allow-list of exact licence names, and runs in the ``core-build``
and ``full-build`` jobs. Node had no equivalent -- ``license-checker`` was used
only to *generate* ``THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md``, never to gate -- so a
dependency arriving under GPL or SSPL would have been reported and merged.

An allow-list of exact names, for the same reason ``core_build.sh`` spells one
out rather than using ``pip-licenses --fail-on``: substring matching on licence
names is wrong in both directions. ``GPL`` matches ``LGPL-3.0-or-later`` and
``AGPL-3.0``, so a deny-list of ``GPL`` fails a package that is merely LGPL;
and a permissive allow-list entry can swallow a copyleft name it happens to
contain. Exact names, checked one at a time.

``--production``: devDependencies do not reach the image. The dashboard image
serves a static export, so what ships is the build output of this closure.
