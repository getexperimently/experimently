# One API fuzzing pass on this machine, with fuzz.yml's flags, filters, lists
# and verdict:
#
#   make fuzz FUZZ_SEED=<seed> SHA=<commit> PASS=<superuser|viewer|sdk>
#
# A public run prints counts only; this is where the failing operations are
# looked at. It
#
#   * refuses unless SHA is the commit checked out (HEAD) and the tree is
#     clean -- it never checks anything out itself, so the stack under test is
#     built from exactly that commit;
#   * removes whatever a killed run left of its compose project, then builds
#     and starts the API with Postgres and Redis as that project,
#     experimently-fuzz, on its own ports (API 18700) and its own image tag
#     (experimently-api:fuzz), with the full profile and the data seed set
#     here (SEED=demo, plus sdk-contract for the sdk pass) -- never the make
#     variable -- and with tests/fuzz/compose.fuzz.yml giving the api the
#     workflow's AWS variables (every AWS call to a closed local port) and the
#     database and Redis the workflow's images;
#   * runs Schemathesis with the workflow's flags (the same filters, from
#     scripts/fuzz_check.py) in a new temporary directory outside the tree,
#     which holds its report, its output and the operations and requests
#     behind each count (details.json), and prints that directory's path;
#   * resolves which route answered each 5xx inside the api container (the
#     image and environment that answered it), as the workflow does on the
#     runner;
#   * removes the compose project, its volumes and the experimently-api:fuzz
#     image on the way out, whatever the result, and exits with the pass's
#     verdict (0 green, 1 red).
#
# How this stack differs from the workflow's: the API runs from the image,
# which installs backend/requirements/runtime.lock and modules/requirements.lock
# (the packages that ship), behind docker-compose.yml's entrypoint and
# environment; the workflow runs uvicorn on the runner from
# backend/requirements.txt and modules/requirements.txt, which leave some
# packages unpinned. Measured on the pull request that gave both stacks the
# same AWS variables and database image: on one runner, at one commit and seed
# 20261006, this and the workflow's pass found the same set of routes
# answering 5xx and the same set of unreached operations, in all three
# passes. The known-5xx and unreached lists are judged against the workflow's
# runs; a difference from them here is worth a look on the runner before it
# is read as a defect.
#
# The API key and bearer token are read into variables and never printed.
