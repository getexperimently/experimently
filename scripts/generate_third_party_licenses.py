"""Regenerate THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md from what the project actually depends on.

Sources
-------
Python   `pip-licenses` against the active virtualenv, which must be
         installed from `backend/requirements/runtime.lock` plus
         `modules/requirements.lock` -- the closures the images install, and
         the only ones that resolve to the same versions twice. See
         `REQUIREMENTS`.
Node     `npx license-checker-rseidelsohn --production` in each package that has
         a `package-lock.json` (the dashboard and the five JavaScript SDKs).
Other    Declared direct dependencies read out of the per-SDK manifests
         (go.mod, pom.xml, build.gradle.kts, composer.json, mix.exs,
         pubspec.yaml, Package.swift, *.csproj). No resolver is run for these
         ecosystems because the repository does not vendor their toolchains;
         the licence column is the upstream project's published licence.

The environment decides the answer
----------------------------------
Both resolvers read the machine they run on, not the lock files, so this
script only produces a correct document in an environment that matches what
ships:

* `pip-licenses` reports the active virtualenv. A pin that is not installed
  was silently skipped, so a developer with a partial venv got a shorter file
  and no warning.
* `license-checker` reads `node_modules`, and npm installs the **current
  platform's** optional binaries. `sharp` -- Next's image dependency -- ships
  per-platform: a macOS run records `@img/sharp-darwin-arm64` in the
  attribution record for a Linux image. A package with no `node_modules` at
  all does not error; it reports one entry and exits 0.

So `--check` refuses to run outside a matching environment rather than write
a plausible wrong answer (#170). `.github/workflows/third-party-licenses.yml`
is that environment; `--allow-foreign-platform` is for local debugging and
will not let you write the file.

Usage
-----
    # what CI does -- the locks, under --require-hashes
    pip install --require-hashes \
      -r backend/requirements/runtime.lock -r modules/requirements.lock
    pip install pip-licenses
    npm ci   # in each package in NODE_PACKAGES
    python scripts/generate_third_party_licenses.py --check

    # to rewrite the file (same environment required)
    python scripts/generate_third_party_licenses.py

# This project is Apache-2.0, a permissive licence: a dependency is a problem
# when its own terms would reach the combined work.  Strong copyleft (GPL,
# AGPL) does exactly that -- a GPL library in the runtime closure would bind
# the distribution to the GPL, and the AGPL adds the network-use clause on
# top -- so those two are the ones to keep out.  Weak copyleft (LGPL, MPL,
# EPL, CDDL) only reaches the library itself: linking an unmodified copy is
# fine, modifications to the library must be published under its licence.
# psycopg2-binary (LGPL) is the standing example and is deliberately allowed.
#
# Matched as whole licence identifiers, not substrings.  A plain
# `"GPL" in lic.lower()` reports LGPL and AGPL as plain GPL and gives them the
# wrong note; the lookbehind keeps `GPL` from matching inside `LGPL`/`AGPL`,
# and the list is ordered most specific first so the right note wins.

#: * **Scope.** An attribution record covers what we hand to someone else.
#:   Nobody receives `pytest` or `aws-cdk-lib` from this project -- a developer
#:   fetches those from PyPI themselves. The images are the artefact.
#: * **Reproducibility.** `requirements.txt` pins its direct dependencies and
#:   leaves pip to resolve the rest, so a transitive's version in this
#:   document was whatever PyPI served that day. The gate's second run failed
#:   on `platformdirs 4.11.11 -> 4.11.12` with no dependency change in the
#:   pull request at all -- a check that goes red on its own is one that gets
#:   disabled. These locks are `uv pip compile --universal --generate-hashes`
#:   output: every transitive pinned, every artefact hashed, byte-identical
#:   every run.
