"""Refuse to let a secret or a false claim into this repository.

This replaces `scripts/publish/export.sh`'s sweep, and it replaces it because
the sweep can no longer work. The sweep was CORRECTIVE: development happened
in a private repository, and a filter-repo export stripped the forbidden
material on the way out. Development is public now, so there is no "way out"
left to strip anything on -- a push is publication. The check has to be
PREVENTIVE, which means it has to run here, in the open, which means it cannot
carry the strings it forbids.

That constraint sounds fatal and is not, because the old forbidden.txt held two
kinds of rule and only one of them was ever secret:

  id  the real AWS account id, and a developer home path.  SECRET.
  mr  fabricated figures ("99.97", "58M+").                not secret.
  re  claims the project will not make ("SOC 2 Type II").  not secret.

The `mr` and `re` rules ship verbatim below. Publishing "this project must
never claim SOC 2 Type II" costs nothing and says something true.

The two `id` rules are matched by SHAPE instead: any AWS account id in an AWS
context, any developer home path. That is strictly stronger than the literals
were -- it catches the next contributor's home directory and a second AWS
account, neither of which a literal list would have known about -- and it
publishes nothing.

A hashed literal list was the obvious alternative and is worthless here: an
AWS account id is twelve digits, a space of 10^12, which any laptop exhausts
against a stored hash in minutes. Shape matching is not a compromise; it is
the only thing that works.

Usage:
    scripts/leak_guard.py                 every tracked file, and no messages
    scripts/leak_guard.py --staged        what is staged (the pre-push hook)
    scripts/leak_guard.py --range A..B    those files AND those commit messages

Exit 0 clean, 1 on any finding, 2 on a usage error.

Commit messages are scanned because that is precisely how this escaped once
before: the tree was clean, the sweep reported PASS, and sixteen commit
messages in the published history contained an absolute home path. A check
that reads only files is a check that has already missed this.

# SHAPE rules. These stand in for the secret `id` rules and are scanned in

# from its own check is the bug that produced the incident this file exists

# not match its own source text: `[0-9]{12}` contains no run of twelve digits,
# and `/Users/[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+` is `/Users/` followed by `[`, which is not in
# the character class it opens. Do not add a shape rule that is a bare
