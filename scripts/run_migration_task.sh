# An ARN with a revision, never a family (QA 1c): a bare family resolves to
# its newest ACTIVE revision, which is whatever registered last -- a
# CloudFormation `bootstrap` revision after a `cdk deploy`, or another run's.
# `run-task`'s overrides cannot change the image (containerOverrides has no
# image field), so the image is chosen by registering a revision, and that
# revision is what runs.
#
# The wait is a loop with its own deadline, not `aws ecs wait tasks-stopped`,
# whose limit (100 polls of 6 s) is shorter than a large migration and whose
# timeout reads as a failure. A migration that outlives the deadline is still
# running: re-running it would start a second one against the same database.
#
# Exit status: 0 the task exited 0; 1 anything else.
