"""What the docs journeys' runs add up to: one rolling issue per failing guide,
and the launch walkthroughs a run keeps.

Two commands read with ``gh`` only, and one reads the run directory:

``deployed``
    Run by ``docs-journeys.yml`` before the journeys: which commit the
    published documentation site was built from. The site is deployed from
    release tags (``docs.yml``), so it lags ``main``; the docs-site journey
    compares it with that commit's ``mkdocs.yml`` and ``docs/``, not with
    ``main``'s. It is the newest deployment to the ``github-pages`` environment,
    by ``created_at``, whose latest status is ``success``. A newer deployment
    does not mark the one before it ``inactive`` here (measured on 2026-10-06:
    the latest status of each of the last eight deployments was ``success``,
    none ``inactive``), so what picks the live one is its date; a newer one
    that failed or is still deploying is passed over. Writes ``sha`` and
    ``ref`` under ``--out``; fails when there is none.

``report``
    Run after the journeys. It reads this run's
``verdicts.json`` (written by the runner, ``tests/acceptance/docs``), the
verdicts of the scheduled runs before it on ``main`` (each run uploads its own
as the artifact ``docs-journeys-verdicts``) and the open ``docs-journey-failure``
issues, decides what to post for each guide, renders the text with
``qa_render`` and writes it under ``--out``: one directory per post under
``posts/`` holding ``action`` (``open``, ``comment`` or ``close``), ``issue``
(the number to comment on or close), ``title.txt`` (for ``open``) and
``body.md``. ``gh`` is only read here; posting is the workflow's, with
``--body-file``. The rules (``.github/qa-templates/README.md``):

* a guide that fails opens its issue on the ``OPEN_AFTER``-th scheduled run in
  a row in which it failed, when none is open; one red night can be the site
  or the network for a moment, two in a row are not, and at one run a night a
  third would add a day before anyone hears;
* while its issue is open, a failing guide comments only when its failing step
  differs from the step the issue or its latest comment names;
* the first run in which the guide passes (or is PARTIAL: nothing failed)
  comments its report header and closes the issue;
* a run with no verdicts (the journeys did not start), or one in which the
  guide did not run, counts as neither a failure nor a pass.

Only a scheduled run on ``main`` posts. Any other run (a dispatch, a run on
another branch) decides the same way, as if it were the next scheduled run, and
prints what it would post: a dry run.

``recordings``
    Run by ``docs-journeys.yml`` after the journeys, in every run that records
    (a scheduled run, any run on ``main`` or a release tag, and a dispatch with
    ``record_video``): the presence check that makes T138's "recordings R1-R8
    in that run's artifacts" mechanical. It reads
    ``tests/acceptance/docs/recordings.toml`` and the run directory's
    ``recordings/``, and fails unless every walkthrough R1-R8 has a table that
    is not ``pending``, and each such table's ``recordings/<name>.webm`` is
    there, not empty, a WebM of 1280x720 whose header gives a length above 0
    and at most its ``max_seconds``. A ``pending`` table's file must not be
    there (the change that records it removes the ``pending`` line), and
    every file under ``recordings/`` must be a table's. It prints each file's
    name, size and length, and the problems as annotations: names and numbers
    only.

Text is rendered only from ``docs-journey-issue.tmpl`` (the issue, and the
comment when the failing step changes; its body is the guide's
``docs-guide-fail.tmpl`` header) and ``docs-guide-pass.tmpl`` or
``docs-guide-partial.tmpl`` (the closing comment: the guide's header in the
run that recovered). Printed text is guide paths, step numbers, counts and
fixed sentences only.
