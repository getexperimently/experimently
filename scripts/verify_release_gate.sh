#
# Exit status: 0 the gate passed; 1 refused (no result, failed, or still
# running); 2 could not ask (bad arguments, or the API call failed).
#
# How it asks, and why each part is there:
#
# * `?check_name=Release%20Gate%20Summary` -- the API filters by name. The
#   unfiltered list is paginated at 30, and a release commit carries 33 or more
#   check runs, so an unfiltered, unpaginated read could simply not see the
#   gate and report it absent (v0.2.7's commit: the gate was on page 2).
# * `--paginate` anyway -- a commit whose gate was re-run several times has
#   several runs with this name.
# * the name is compared EXACTLY as well. A reusable-workflow caller reports
#   its job as `<caller> / Release Gate Summary`; the server-side filter does
#   not return that, and if some future API did, it is not the gate this
#   repository's release-gate.yml reports, so it counts as absent. Failing
#   closed on a naming change is the point.
# * the LATEST completed run wins, so a re-run that passed after a flaky
#   failure is honoured, and a later failure is not hidden by an earlier pass.
#   Any run still in progress refuses outright: its result is unknown.
#
# Needs `gh` (GH_TOKEN in the environment) and nothing else; the workflow runs
# it in a job that holds no AWS credential.
