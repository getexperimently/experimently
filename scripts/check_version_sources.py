"""Fail when the places that carry the version stop agreeing.

``VERSION`` at the repository root is the one source (see
``backend/app/core/version.py``).  Everything else quotes it, and every one of
them can drift *silently*:

* ``.release-please-manifest.json`` -- release-please's own idea of where the
  tree is.  If it and ``VERSION`` disagree, the next release PR proposes a
  version nobody expects, or none at all.
* the built distribution metadata -- ``pyproject.toml`` reads ``VERSION``
  through setuptools' ``dynamic`` version, and a build that cannot find the
  file **does not fail**: it warns and emits ``0.0.0``.  Verified against
  setuptools 80: a tree with no ``VERSION`` builds a wheel called
  ``experimently-platform-0.0.0``, with no error anywhere.
  Note what this check does *not* cover: it reads the source tree, where
  ``VERSION`` always is, so it says nothing about whether the published sdist
  carries the file.  That is a separate invariant, pinned separately by
  ``backend/tests/smoke/test_version_sources.py`` -- which is where it belongs,
  because setuptools includes the file on its own and no edit to
  ``MANIFEST.in`` could be found that stops it, so a check here could only ever
  pass.
* ``settings.VERSION`` -- what ``/health`` and ``GET /api/v1/modules`` report,
  and so what an operator reads off a running deployment.
* ``charts/experimently/Chart.yaml`` ``version`` and ``appVersion`` -- the Helm
  chart's version is the platform's, and its default image tag is
  ``<profile>-<appVersion>``.  release-please updates both lines only because
  each carries an ``x-release-please-version`` marker; a lost marker is a
  silent no-op on its side, so it is caught here.
* the two published-image lines of ``deploy/compose/compose.yml`` -- what a
  self-hoster who downloads that file at a tag actually runs.  release-please
  rewrites them (``x-release-please-version``); a line it missed would start
  the previous release with no error anywhere.
* the git tag, when run with ``--expect`` (the release workflow passes the tag
  it is building, so a tag that does not match the tree never becomes images).

Run by ``backend/tests/smoke/test_version_sources.py`` -- so every pull request
-- and by ``.github/workflows/release.yml``, with ``--expect``, before anything
is pushed anywhere.  Not by ``make lint``: that target and the ``lint`` CI job
are kept identical, and the CI job installs ruff, import-linter and reuse, not
the backend closure this needs.

Usage::

    python scripts/check_version_sources.py              # the tree agrees
    python scripts/check_version_sources.py --expect 1.2.3   # ...and is 1.2.3
