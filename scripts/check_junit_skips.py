"""Fail when a test under a directory was skipped, or when none ran at all.

    python3 scripts/check_junit_skips.py <junit.xml> <tests directory> [...]

The workflow tests (`backend/tests/unit/infrastructure`) and the CDK suite
(`infrastructure/tests`) mostly `skipif` their subject file is absent, so that
a distribution which does not ship `.github/workflows` has nothing to check.
The same guard makes a RENAME silent: renaming the deploy workflow without
updating the constants that name it skipped 19 tests, and both jobs stayed
green (QA SILENT 1). Nothing in either suite skips on a full checkout, so the
jobs that run one assert exactly that: zero skipped, and at least one test
found under each directory (a scope that matches nothing is a vacuous pass).

A directory is matched through the JUnit ``classname``, which pytest writes as
the dotted module path (``backend.tests.unit.infrastructure.test_x.TestY``, or
``infrastructure.tests.test_x`` under ``--import-mode=importlib``).

Exit status: 0 no skips; 1 skips, or nothing found; 2 unreadable report.
