"""Decide an API fuzzing pass from its Schemathesis report.

The fuzz arm of ``.github/workflows/_platform.yml`` and ``make fuzz`` both run
Schemathesis against a running API and then ask this script for the verdict.
Schemathesis's own exit status is never the verdict: it is 1 on any server
error, known or not, and 0 on a run that reached nothing at all.

Four subcommands, reading the served OpenAPI document and the lists under
``tests/fuzz/``:

``args``
    The Schemathesis filter arguments for one pass, one argument per line: the
    ``sdk`` pass is restricted to the SDK routes, and every pass leaves out the
    operations ``tests/fuzz/exclusions.toml`` names for it.

``requests``
    The requests of the pass's ndjson report that were answered 5xx, as a
    JSON file: each one's method, the path as it was sent, its status and the
    Schemathesis label it was generated under. Standard library only.

``routes``
    Which route of the application answered each of those requests, resolved
    by the application's own router: it imports ``backend.app.main`` (from
    ``--app-root``), refuses unless that application's operations are exactly
    the served document's, and dispatches each request's method and path
    through ``app.router`` with every route handler replaced by one that only
    records which route the router chose (see ``resolve_routes``). It runs
    where the API's packages are installed: on the CI runner, and inside the
    API container for ``make fuzz``, both times with the database and Redis
    pointed at a closed port, so that nothing could be written even if a
    handler did run.

``evaluate``
    Decide the pass. The pass selects the served document's operations, minus
    its exclusions (and, for ``sdk``, only the SDK routes). For each one, only
    the interactions whose method is the operation's own count, so the
    coverage phase's method probes (answered 405) do not. An operation is
    REACHED when one counted interaction answered a status outside
    ``NOT_REACHED``; otherwise, or when the report has no interaction for it,
    it is UNREACHED. A 5xx is counted against the route that ANSWERED it, not
    the label it was generated under: a ``DELETE`` probe sent to the path of
    ``GET /users/me`` is answered by ``DELETE /users/{user_id}``. The pass is
    green only when:

    * every (answering route, status) that answered 5xx is listed for this
      pass in ``tests/fuzz/known-5xx.toml``, and every entry listed for this
      pass answered 5xx in this run (an entry that no longer fires is stale);
    * every UNREACHED operation is listed for this pass in
      ``tests/fuzz/unreached.toml``, and no listed operation was reached (a
      stale entry);
    * Schemathesis selected exactly the operations this pass selects, and
      fuzzed nothing else;
    * the report exists and holds at least one interaction, and every 5xx
      request's answering route was resolved.

Everything this script prints, the step summary it renders (through
``scripts/qa_render.py`` from ``.github/qa-templates/fuzz-*.tmpl``) and the
values it writes for the workflow's issue are counts, the pass, the date, the
commit and the seed. Which operations failed or were not reached, and the
requests behind each 5xx, go only to the ``--details`` file, which ``make
fuzz`` writes into its reproduction directory and the workflow never asks for,
and to the ``requests`` and ``routes`` files, which stay on the runner.
Nothing here ever reads a request or response body.

Exit status: 0 green, 1 red, 2 a list or an argument it refuses.
