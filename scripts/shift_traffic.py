"""Approve a forward CodeDeploy deployment and wait until the API serves it (#143).

    python3 scripts/shift_traffic.py --deployment-id d-XXXX \\
        --cluster experimentation-<env> --service experimentation-backend-<env> \\
        --task-definition <ARN> --deadline-seconds N --interval-seconds M

This is rollback.yml's polling loop, applied to the forward deploy.

* `Ready` is the deployment group's approval wait: CodeDeploy has started
  the replacement task set and waits up to 30 minutes for ContinueDeployment,
  then stops the deployment. Before approving, every target in the
  replacement task set's target group must be `healthy`, and the count must
  equal the task set's desired count (PE v2 C6(b)). Until they are, it keeps
  polling. Then it sends `continue-deployment --deployment-wait-type
  READY_WAIT`, once. `READY_WAIT` is passed explicitly and never
  `TERMINATION_WAIT` (PE v2 C7).
* `Failed` and `Stopped` end the run red. `Baking` is not terminal. When
  CodeDeploy stopped it for an alarm (`errorInformation.code ==
  ALARM_ACTIVE`, whichever of the two the status is), the result is `alarm`
  and the copy names the alarm. It says the API is going back only when
  CodeDeploy reports a rollback (`rollbackInfo`), and it never advises
  Rollback: CodeDeploy's own rollback is already doing that (#148).
* SUCCESS is `scripts/api_serving.py`'s verdict, checked after every poll:
  the PRIMARY task set is this revision, and check_live_target_group.py
  confirms that the `/api/*` rule forwards to that task set's target group
  (PE v2 C8). A split rule means the shift is still going, so it retries until
  the deadline. "Could not tell" ends the run red. An unsplit rule to the
  other group ends it red too, but only after a bounded grace once the shift
  is approved: an alarm rollback can put the rule back a little before the
  deployment's status says Stopped, and that must end as `alarm`, not
  `wrong-route` (#148 PE condition 5). The grace is `--wrong-route-grace-polls`
  consecutive polls at the usual interval, and the deadline still applies.
* It does not wait for `Succeeded`. After the shift, the deployment group
  keeps the old task set for an hour and the deployment stays active. In that
  hour the deployment group's alarms still watch the API, and CodeDeploy
  rolls it back by itself if one goes into ALARM; this run has ended by then,
  so it cannot report that. It is also the window in which Rollback can act
  (DECISIONS T21).

It NEVER stops a deployment. The only CodeDeploy write it can make is
`continue-deployment`. Two allow-lists cover every AWS call it makes:
`OPERATIONS` below, for its own `run_aws` (the deployment, the replacement
task set, target health), and `check_live_target_group.READ_ONLY_OPERATIONS`,
four describe calls, for the `serving()` path through `api_serving.py`. Each
`run_aws` refuses anything outside its list before a process starts. A deadline passed
before the approval leaves the deployment to CodeDeploy, which stops it when
the approval wait ends; nothing has shifted by then. A deadline passed after
the approval leaves it running. Stopping a deployment whose traffic has
shifted rolls back a release that may be succeeding (#143).

Deadlines and intervals are parameters. The unit tests run with 0.

Exit status: 0 the API is serving the revision; 1 anything else, with the
reason on stdout as a workflow `::error`. An exception it does not expect (a
missing `aws` binary, a malformed rule) is `result=unknown` with its type and
message, not an uncaught traceback with no `result`. When `GITHUB_OUTPUT` is set it
writes `approved=true` as soon as it approves the shift, `result` (serving |
failed | alarm | unhealthy | timeout | wrong-route | unknown), on success
`live_target_group`, `shifted_at` (UTC, when the API was first seen serving)
and `bake_end` (`shifted_at` plus `--bake-minutes`, "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM" UTC:
roughly when the deployment group stops watching), and on `alarm` the alarm's
name(s) as `alarms` (never empty).
