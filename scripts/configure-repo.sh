# Everything here is idempotent -- re-running it re-asserts the same settings
# and reads each one back rather than trusting the response to the write. Run
# it after changing a required check, or to check nothing has drifted.
#
# It changes required-check NAMES and nothing else about branch protection.
# Before it writes anything it runs scripts/check_required_checks.sh against
# live protection, and refuses -- writing nothing -- if live differs from what
# it would write in any other way: `strict`, the review rule, the app each
# check is pinned to, or the other protection flags. Those are the founder's
# decision, not this file's, and a PUT here would silently replace them.
# `--print-protection-payload` prints the protection body it would PUT and
# exits without calling GitHub; check_required_checks.sh reads it from there.
#
# It was `scripts/publish/configure-public-repo.sh` and ran once, by hand,
# immediately after the repository was flipped to public: neither branch
# protection nor secret scanning can be configured on a PRIVATE repository on
# this plan (the API answers `403 Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository
# public to enable this feature`), so it could not be part of the export. There
# is no export any more -- development happens here -- so it is simply the
# repository's settings script now.
