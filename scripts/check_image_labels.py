"""Assert an image's OCI labels.

``.github/workflows/release.yml`` runs this against every image it has just
pushed, before signing it, and the Docker Smoke job in
``.github/workflows/pr-qa-gate.yml`` runs it against the images it builds on
every pull request.  The labels are the only place the version appears
outside the tag -- ``docker inspect`` is what an operator reaches for to answer
"what is this container" -- and they are set from a build argument, so a
renamed ``ARG`` in either Dockerfile would leave every released image labelled
``0.0.0+unknown`` with nothing else in the pipeline noticing.

The labels also say where the image came from.  ``source`` and ``url`` are
inherited from the base image unless overridden, and the dashboard's base
(``nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged``) sets both to nginx's repository, so an image
without its own pair names the wrong project.  Both must equal :data:`SOURCE`.

Input is either the registry's view,
``docker buildx imagetools inspect <ref> --format '{{ json .Image }}'``, whose
shape depends on the manifest:

* single platform -> one image config object (``{"created":…, "config":…}``);
* several         -> a map of ``"linux/amd64"`` -> that object;

or the local daemon's, ``docker image inspect <ref>``: a JSON list of objects
with ``Config``/``Os``/``Architecture`` (capitalised), one per reference.

Both are handled, and every platform is checked: an image whose arm64 variant
was built without the argument is exactly the defect this catches.  Verified
against a real registry in both shapes -- and buildx's provenance and SBOM
attestation manifests, which ride along in the same index, do *not* appear
here, so they need no special case.
