"""Refuse an SDK tag that does not match the package it would publish.

SDKs version independently of the platform (``sdk/<name>/vX.Y.Z``, the Go
convention reused for all of them), so ``VERSION`` at the repository root says
nothing about them and ``scripts/check_version_sources.py`` cannot help.  What
can still go wrong is the same thing: a tag pushed without the version bump
committed, which publishes ``1.0.0`` a second time (PyPI and npm both refuse
that, *after* the workflow has already built and tested) or, worse, publishes
the previous version's code under the new tag's name in an ecosystem that
allows it.

So: read the manifest the publish step will read, and compare.

Usage::

    python scripts/check_sdk_version.py js --expect 1.2.3
    python scripts/check_sdk_version.py python            # just print it
