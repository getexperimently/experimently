"""Repository-root conftest.

pytest loads it for every session whose rootdir is the repository root (the
``[tool.pytest.ini_options]`` in pyproject.toml): backend/tests,
modules/backend/tests, each backend/lambda/<function>, infrastructure/tests
and tests/sdk-contract. The two SDK suites have their own rootdir and carry
their own copy.

It carries four plugins, and must stay importable with only pytest installed
(tests/sdk-contract runs that way): no test may reach real AWS credentials or
the real ``aws`` binary (backend/tests/no_real_aws.py), and a test marked
``benchmark`` -- an absolute wall-clock check -- is skipped unless
``RUN_BENCHMARKS=1`` (backend/tests/benchmark_gate.py). A third plugin acts only
on the Lambda suites: a test under backend/lambda/ or modules/lambda/ that
opens a connection to anything but loopback fails
(backend/tests/no_outbound_network.py). The fourth does nothing unless
``EXPERIMENTLY_TEST_SHARD`` is set: it then runs one slice of the session and
records what ran, for scripts/check_test_shards.py (backend/tests/shard.py).
