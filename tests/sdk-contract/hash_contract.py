"""Run each SDK's own exported hash function against golden-vectors.json.

    python tests/sdk-contract/hash_contract.py --list     # classify every sdk/ dir
    python tests/sdk-contract/hash_contract.py python     # one SDK
    python tests/sdk-contract/hash_contract.py js edge    # several

Each SDK has a thin harness under ``harness/`` that imports the SDK's real,
exported hash function (from the SDK's source or its built package), reads the
``[user_id, flag_key]`` inputs as JSON on stdin and prints what the SDK returned
as JSON on stdout. This script is the only place the SDK's answers are compared
with the vectors, so every SDK is judged by the same rule:

* the hash is within 1e-10 of ``expected_hash`` (one bucket is 2**-32, about
  2.3e-10, so a hash that is off by one bucket fails);
* the MD5 hex digest equals ``md5_hex``, for an SDK that exports one;
* the 3 / 5 / 50 / 100 % rollout inclusions of ``rollout_vectors`` hold;
* exactly ``EXPECTED_HASH_VECTORS`` hash vectors and ``EXPECTED_ROLLOUT_VECTORS``
  rollout vectors were checked. A vector file that lost entries, or a harness
  that returned fewer answers than it was asked for, fails rather than passing
  on fewer checks.

An SDK directory under ``sdk/`` is either in ``RUNNERS`` or in ``NOT_RUN`` with
the reason; ``--list`` fails on a directory that is in neither, so a new SDK
cannot drop out of this job unnoticed.
