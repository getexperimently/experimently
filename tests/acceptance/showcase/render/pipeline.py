"""Render one capture directory into the finished video, its captions and its review page.

The order matters, and each step is a gate that refuses rather than warns:

1. ``disk``: at least ``contract.DISK_FLOOR_BYTES`` free where the work and
   the output go (checked again before the OCR decode).
2. ``capture``: ``contract.validate_capture_dir`` accepts the directory, which
   includes gate 3 (every frame is a real 1920x940 page, never one the encode
   would scale up) and every capture gate ok.
3. ``7`` (text): no caption or card text holds a needle.
4. ``17``: every caption, as Chromium draws it, is at least 36 px, on at
   most two lines, none wider than the band allows.
5. ``7`` (self-test): every OCR engine reads a made-up canary back.
6. The encode, to ``<out>/<slug>.mp4.partial``.
7. ``1`` and ``2``: length, format, faststart. ``11``: no black page outside
   the cards. ``4``: the WebVTT file, parsed back strictly, matches the cue
   sheet. ``5``: every burned-in caption is read back from the frames.
   ``7`` and ``U4``: OCR of every distinct frame of the finished video.
8. The review page, the sha256-named files, and only then the renames.

needles.txt is deleted on every path out of ``render``, pass or refuse, once
the render has started; its values live only in memory, and only until the
review page has been checked against them. So a refusal, even a passing one
such as low disk, means the capture has to be made again, and every refusal
says so ("re-capture needed").

Everything the render makes is written in its work directory, the ``.partial``
files and the review page included, and reaches the output directory only by
a hard link or a rename once every gate passed. The work directory is deleted
on every way out (emptied, if it was there before), through
``WorkDir.remove``, the only code in the render that deletes (EM condition
7e). The ``paths`` gate refuses an output directory that is the work
directory, or inside it, or around it.
