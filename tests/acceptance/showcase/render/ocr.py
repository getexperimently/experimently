"""OCR over the finished video: the captions are there (gate 5), and no credential is (gate 7).

The page check during capture reads the DOM; it cannot see a canvas,
CSS-generated text, a closed shadow root or a toast that came and went
between two checks. So the render reads the pixels too: it decodes the
finished MP4, counts every frame (exactly ``video_frames``), keeps one of each
distinct frame (by its decoded checksum), and reads every one of those with
every OCR engine on the machine: macOS Vision through a small Swift program
built here, and tesseract. A frame is refused when its text holds:

* a needle (a value from needles.txt), or part of one, read fuzzily. Both
  sides lose case, whitespace, ``_``, ``-`` and ``:``, and the characters OCR
  confuses are folded together (0/O/@, 1/l/I/|, f/t, 2/Z, 5/S, 8/B, and
  Cyrillic and Greek look-alikes): ``contract.normalise``. The needle is then
  cut into pieces (``chunks``): the whole of it when it is 24 characters or
  fewer, else 24-character pieces 8 apart; and, when it is longer than 12,
  also 12-character pieces 4 apart. A frame is refused when some stretch of
  its text is within 30 % edits of a piece (``NEEDLE_THRESHOLD``). So these
  are found: a whole needle of up to 24 characters with up to 30 % of them
  misread, lost or added; one of a longer needle's 24-character pieces with
  up to 7; and any 12 or more characters of a needle in a row, read as
  written (cut off by the edge of the page or a column, or wrapped onto two
  lines), or one of its 12-character pieces with up to 3 misread. Fewer than
  12 characters of a needle longer than that are not looked for: a stretch
  that short cannot be told apart from ordinary page text;
* key-shaped text: a word starting ``eptk`` (the API key prefix) with 5 or
  more key characters after it, or ``eyJ`` (a JSON web token) with 20 or more;
* (U4) a phrase that must never be on screen: a local address, an error, a
  disconnected live view, a test leftover.

Before any of that, a canary frame with made-up values is put through the
same encode: a value at 16 px and a key at 14 px, both #0F172A, which every
engine must read, and a value in the faint small style
``templates.FAINT_CANARY_PX`` px ``templates.FAINT_CANARY_COLOUR`` (13 px
#94A3B8), which at least one engine must read. Otherwise the scan is not run
and the render refuses ("OCR self-test ... scan not run"). The faint style is
under anything the dashboard draws at the capture's zoom of 4/3 (measured in
``frontend/src``: its faintest text is slate-400 or gray-400, 2.56 and 2.54
to 1 on white, at 12 px at the smallest, so 16 px in the frame; its smallest
text is 11 px, 14.7 px in the frame). Text smaller or fainter than the faint
canary is not claimed. One engine is enough for the faint value because the
engines miss it in different places (measured: on the canary page Vision read
it at 1.00 and tesseract at 0.25 to 0.50 in 7 runs; on a page with nothing
else, the other way round), and a frame is refused when either engine reads a
needle. An engine that fails on any frame stops the scan too, as does a
decode or an extraction that does not give exactly the frames asked for: a
scan that read nothing never counts as a clean one. No refusal text ever
holds a needle or the text OCR read.
