"""An SDK's quick start, installed from the public registry and run as its page says.

An ``sdk`` step (compose-dev only) follows an SDK page the way its reader does:

1. In a fresh temporary directory it makes a project (``package.json`` holding
   ``{"private": true}``) or a virtual environment (``python -m venv``), and
   runs the page's install command exactly: the first shell block of the
   section the step names as ``install``, which must be one line,
   ``npm install <package>@<version>`` or ``pip install <package>==<version>``.
   npm is pointed at ``NPM_REGISTRY`` and pip at ``PYPI_INDEX``, with no user
   configuration and no cache, so the package comes from the public registry.
   An install that does not exit 0, or that installs any other version, fails
   the step: it is never NOT RUN.
2. It writes the page's code block (the first fenced block of the section the
   step names as ``snippet``, in the step's ``language``) to a file, with only
   the page's placeholders replaced, and runs it: ``node`` with its type
   stripping for TypeScript, the environment's ``python`` for Python. A
   placeholder is a whole quoted string of the block (``'user-123'``,
   ``"http://localhost:8000"``), replaced by one of ``PLACEHOLDERS``: the
   stack's API address, the experiment's key, the flag's key, the step's user.
   The API key is given as ``EXPERIMENTLY_API_KEY`` and the API's address as
   ``EXPERIMENTLY_API_URL``, the variables the pages' blocks read.
3. Before the block, each of the step's ``stubs`` is defined: a function the
   block calls that the page leaves to the reader (``render_new_checkout()``),
   which records that it was called and does nothing else. After the block,
   one line is printed: the value of each expression the step's ``answers``
   name (a variable of the block, an attribute or key path under one, or
   ``called.<stub>``). Nothing else is added to the block.
4. Each answer must be what the oracle gives, independently of the SDK
   (``traffic.py``): the variant the documented assignment hash gives the user
   under the experiment's key and allocations, and the flag answer the
   documented rollout hash gives at the step's percentage (reason
   ``rollout``).

Go (``language: go``) differs in three places, because its install is not one
pinned line and nothing can be appended to its block (an unused variable or
import does not compile):

* The install section's first shell block holds the page's own commands, run
  as written and in the page's order: at most one ``go mod init <path>`` and
  exactly one ``go get <module>[@<version>]``. The runner never writes go.mod,
  so a page that drops ``go mod init`` fails at ``go get`` ("go.mod file not
  found"), as its reader would. ``go`` is the one on PATH (setup-go installs
  the line sdk/go/go.mod's ``go`` directive names): ``go version`` must be
  that line (``go1.21.x`` for ``go 1.21``), and the page's "Requires Go X+"
  must name the directive's version (the loader refuses the journey otherwise,
  ``go_requirement_problem``). Modules come from proxy.golang.org, checked
  against sum.golang.org, with ``GOTOOLCHAIN=local`` and no user configuration
  (``GOENV=off``, ``GOWORK=off``).
* What ``go get`` resolved is recorded (``go list -m -json``) and must be a
  pseudo-version or a semver tag; a ``replace`` of the module, in the project's
  go.mod or in what ``go list`` reports, is refused. The downloaded module
  (``go mod download -json``'s ``Dir``) is compared with this checkout's
  sdk/go, file by file (``comparison_rule``): on a run of a branch (main, or a
  dispatched branch) that resolved a pseudo-version, the head of main, a
  difference fails the step; on a run of a tag, or when ``go get`` resolved a
  semver tag (the module's first release onwards), the difference is recorded
  and does not fail. So a main run fails when sdk/go changed within the module
  proxy's cache window (``go get`` then still resolves the commit before the
  change), and a branch run fails when main's sdk/go has moved past the
  branch's.
* The block is the page's complete ``package main``, written to main.go with
  only its placeholders replaced, and run with ``go run .``. It must print
  exactly one line on stdout, ``key=value`` pairs separated by single spaces
  (``variant=treatment flag=true``), whose keys are exactly the step's
  ``answers`` (``read_line``); ``true`` and ``false`` are read as booleans.
  The block takes no ``stubs``.

Every command's output passes through the run's redactor before it is kept,
and a command whose output held a value the run keeps out of its files (the
API key, a token) fails the step: a quick start must not print a credential.
The directory is removed when the step ends; nothing in it is written to the
run directory, and the key is never written to a file, only given in the
environment of the block's process.

Nothing here imports Playwright or the product; the commands go through an
``execute`` the runner passes in, so the unit job tests the rest with a fake.
