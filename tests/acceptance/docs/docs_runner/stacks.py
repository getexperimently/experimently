"""The five stacks a journey runs against. ``conftest.py`` makes each a fixture.

* ``compose-dev``: the Docker guide's ``docker compose up -d --wait`` at the
  repository root, under its own compose project, with its own host ports, and
  with ``--build``, so the images are the checkout's and never ones left by an
  earlier run. Before ``up``, and after an ``up`` that fails,
  ``docker compose -p <project> down -v --remove-orphans`` clears the project,
  so a run starts from an empty database and leaves nothing running.
  Defaults are well away from a developer's own stack (5432, 6379, 8000, 3000);
  each can be set in the environment:

  ======================================  ===========================  =======
  variable                                compose variable it sets     default
  ======================================  ===========================  =======
  ``DOCS_JOURNEY_COMPOSE_PROJECT``        the compose project name     ``docs-journeys``
  ``DOCS_JOURNEY_API_PORT``               ``API_HOST_PORT``            28000
  ``DOCS_JOURNEY_DASHBOARD_PORT``         ``FRONTEND_HOST_PORT``       23000
  ``DOCS_JOURNEY_POSTGRES_PORT``          ``POSTGRES_HOST_PORT``       25432
  ``DOCS_JOURNEY_REDIS_PORT``             ``REDIS_HOST_PORT``          26379
  ======================================  ===========================  =======

  Compose sees only those, ``EXPERIMENTLY_PROFILE`` (the journey's profile),
  ``EXPERIMENTLY_IMAGE_TAG`` (``<project>-<profile>``, so the images it builds
  are its own), and the few variables Docker itself needs: nothing else from the caller's
  environment, no ``.env`` file (``COMPOSE_DISABLE_ENV_FILE=1``), and no AWS
  configuration. After ``up`` the API's ``/api/v1/modules`` must report the
  journey's profile. The stack is brought down (``down -v``) when the session
  ends, or before a journey of the other profile.

  A guide gives the addresses a reader gets with the default host ports
  (``http://localhost:3000`` for the dashboard, ``http://localhost:8000`` for
  the API). The stack's ``published`` maps each default that
  ``docker-compose.yml`` itself gives the dashboard and the API
  (``${FRONTEND_HOST_PORT:-3000}``, ``${API_HOST_PORT:-8000}``) to where that
  service runs here, so an ``open`` of a guide's address reaches the same
  service on this stack's port, and one of a port the compose file does not
  default to reaches nothing.

* ``compose-sso``: compose-dev's stack in the full profile, brought up the way
  ``docs/auth/sso.md`` tells a compose reader to bring it up for SSO sign-in:
  with the override file its section "Trying it on the Docker Compose stack"
  gives (the first YAML block there, taken from the page at run time and
  passed with ``-f``), plus ``stacks/compose-sso.yml`` beside this runner,
  which adds what a reader brings from outside and the run cannot: an
  identity provider. That provider is ``modules/``'s fake OIDC provider
  (``fake_oidc_provider.py``), run from the API's own image in the API's
  network namespace (``network_mode: "service:api"``), serving https on
  port 28443 with the issuer ``https://localhost:28443/oauth2/default``, so
  the browser and the API reach it at the one address an SSO configuration's
  ``sso_url`` names. Its certificate is signed by a CA made for the run with
  ``openssl`` in a temporary directory outside the checkout and the run
  directory; the CA's key is deleted as soon as the certificate is signed,
  and the directory is removed when the stack comes down. The API is given
  that CA as ``SSL_CERT_FILE``; its sign-in client (authlib over httpx2) then
  builds its TLS context from that file alone, in place of the system's
  store, so on this stack it trusts that CA and no other. The browser's
  context for a journey on
  this stack ignores certificate errors (``Running.ignore_https_errors``);
  no other stack's does. The two files may not set ``ENVIRONMENT``,
  ``APP_ENV`` or ``DEV_AUTH_BYPASS`` on ``api``, nor give it an ``env_file``
  (``refused_api_settings``): the walk is of the development environment a
  compose reader runs, not of ``test``, which allows an ``http`` provider.
  The dashboard and the API are opened at ``localhost``, not ``127.0.0.1``:
  the sign-in's cookie belongs to the host ``PUBLIC_BASE_URL`` names, and the
  page's override names ``localhost``. It shares compose-dev's project, ports
  and images: whichever of the two comes up brings the other down first.
  Before it comes down, what the API and the provider printed is added to its
  log, ``stacks/compose-sso.log``.

A command that cannot be started at all (no ``docker``, no ``npm``) is a
``StackError`` like one that fails, so the journey is reported FAIL before its
first step rather than ending the session.
* ``docs-local``: ``mkdocs build`` into a temporary directory, served by
  ``python -m http.server`` on 127.0.0.1 (``DOCS_JOURNEY_DOCS_PORT``, else a
  free port). Needs the docs toolchain (``scripts/docs_toolchain.sh``). Its
  source is this checkout.
* ``docs-published``: ``DOCS_JOURNEY_PUBLISHED_URL``, by default the site's
  ``site_url``. Only an https URL is accepted. Its source (what a crawl
  compares the site with: ``site.py``) is ``DOCS_JOURNEY_PUBLISHED_SOURCE``, a
  directory holding the ``mkdocs.yml`` and ``docs/`` the published site was
  built from. The site is deployed from release tags, not from ``main``, so
  ``docs-journeys.yml`` sets it to the commit of the site's last successful
  deployment; unset, it is this checkout, which is right only when the
  checkout is that commit. ``DOCS_JOURNEY_PUBLISHED_REF``, when set, names that
  deployment's ref (a tag such as ``v0.25.1``): the crawls say they compared
  the site with it. Anything that is not a ref's characters is refused.
* ``marketing-local``: ``npm run build:marketing`` in ``frontend/`` (which needs
  its ``node_modules``), then ``frontend/out`` served like docs-local
  (``DOCS_JOURNEY_MARKETING_PORT``, else a free port). The build writes Next's
  own output under ``frontend/`` (``.next/``, ``out/``, both ignored by git).

What each command prints goes to ``stacks/<stack>.log`` in the run directory,
never to the console.
