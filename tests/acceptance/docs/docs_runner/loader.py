"""Read one journey file, and refuse what the runner will not run.

``load`` returns a ``Journey`` or raises ``Refused`` with the problems found,
each one line naming the step. It reports them from every stage it reaches:
the checks on the raw YAML, the model's (without repeating what the raw checks
said), and the checks against the guide, the inventory and the registry, run on
the journey or, when the model refuses it, on each part that parsed (the guide,
the stack, the date, each step that is valid on its own). A file that is not
YAML, or not a mapping, stops at that. Refused, besides what ``model`` refuses:

* a CSS or XPath selector: under a key of its own (``selector``, ``css``,
  ``xpath``, a string ``locator``), or a name, label or option in a selector's
  form (``css=...``, ``xpath=...``, ``//...``, or one with ``>>``). Elements are
  found by role and accessible name, as a reader finds them; a name such as
  ``settings.json``, ``.env`` or ``.NET`` is a name;
* a sleep (``sleep``, ``wait``, ``delay``, ``pause``, ...): a step waits for
  what it expects, never for a time;
* a step without ``fail``: what failure looks like is written before the run;
* an unknown stack;
* a ``guide`` the inventory does not classify ``journey`` with this file's
  name as its id, or classifies ``pending = true``;
* a ``doc`` anchor the guide does not have;
* an accessible name or label the guide's text does not contain, unless it says
  ``quote: false`` with a reason, so a label renamed in the UI or in the guide
  alone fails;
* a step on a screen (``goto``, ``click``, ``fill``, ``select``) without
  ``aria``, unless it says ``snapshot: false`` with a ``snapshot_reason`` and
  has a structural expectation (``url``, ``status``, ``visible``, ``text``,
  ``number``) and no ``aria``; an ``api`` step with neither ``status`` nor
  ``json``; a ``search`` step without ``found``; a ``crawl`` step with an
  ``expect``; and an expectation the step's kind cannot have;
* a ``search`` or ``crawl`` step on a stack that serves no documentation site
  (only docs-published and docs-local do), or with a ``snapshot`` setting;
* a journey none of whose steps this runner runs (every step is
  ``ref: doc-examples`` or declares ``not_run``);
* ``ref: doc-examples`` on a section with no shell block Doc Examples runs, or
  on a guide ``scripts/doc_examples.toml`` does not enrol;
* an ``api`` step on a stack with no API (every stack but compose-dev);
* an oracle not in ``docs_runner.oracles.ORACLES``;
* a ``not_run`` reason the registry does not let a journey declare;
* a ``written`` date after today;
* ``open`` on any stack but compose-dev, or of a URL whose origin
  (``http://localhost:<port>``) the guide's text does not contain;
* a ``fill`` that types a ``secret`` no ``passwords`` entry makes up and no
  earlier ``keep`` step keeps, or that does not say ``snapshot: false``;
* a ``keep`` step with an ``expect`` or a ``snapshot`` setting (its check is
  the action, and it keeps no screen);
* a journey that makes up or keeps a secret, or has an api step that reveals
  one (``model.reveals_credential``), and is recorded (``video: true``): a
  recording would show what the run keeps out of its files;
* a screen step right before a ``keep`` step (its screen shows what the keep
  reads) without ``snapshot: false``;
* a ``fill`` that types a written value into a field whose label says
  "password", where its screen is kept, unless the value is the documented
  demo password;
* ``save`` on a step that is not an ``api`` step, or a name saved twice;
* a ``{{name}}`` that no earlier step saves, or that names a secret (a secret
  is sent only as a ``key``); a ``key`` that names no secret saved or kept earlier; a
  traffic step's ``experiment`` that names no value saved earlier;
* a ``traffic`` step on any stack but compose-dev, or with an ``expect`` or a
  ``snapshot`` setting (its check is the action);
* ``computed`` on a step that is not an ``api`` step, and ``cells`` on one that
  is not on a screen, or either naming an oracle not in ``ORACLES``.
