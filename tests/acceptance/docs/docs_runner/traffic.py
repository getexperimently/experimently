"""A known population of users, assigned and converted through the tracking API.

A ``traffic`` step sends an experiment the users a journey chooses, as an
application using an SDK would: each user is assigned with
``POST /api/v1/tracking/assign`` and, for the users that convert, the metric's
event is sent with ``POST /api/v1/tracking/track``, both with an API key
(``X-API-Key``). The journey says how many users each variant gets and how many
of them convert, so the numbers the results must show are known before the run.

Which variant a user lands in is not left to chance. Assignment is a
deterministic hash of the user and the experiment into a bucket in [0, 100),
the variants taking the buckets in their order, each as many as its traffic
allocation (``docs/architecture/technical-guide.md``, "Assignment Algorithm").
The hash is the cross-SDK one (``docs/sdk/javascript.md``, "Hash utilities";
pinned by ``tests/sdk-contract/golden-vectors.json``): the first four bytes of
``MD5("{user_id}:{experiment_key}")`` read as a little-endian unsigned integer
and divided by 2^32, times 100, its integer part the bucket. ``choose`` walks the user ids
``<prefix>-00001``, ``<prefix>-00002``, ... and keeps, per variant, the first
ones the hash puts there until each variant has its count. Every assignment the
API answers is then checked against that: a user answered with another variant,
or not assigned, fails the step. So the counts sent are exactly the counts
chosen, and a disagreement between the API's assignment and the documented hash
is a failure of its own, not a skewed count.

This module computes the hash itself (``hashlib``); it imports nothing from the
product, so an assignment that drifts from the contract is caught rather than
copied. Nothing here imports Playwright: the requests go through a ``fetch``
the runner passes in, and the unit job tests the rest with a fake one.

What a step writes (``NN-<step>.traffic.json``) holds counts and the first few
problems only; never the API key.
