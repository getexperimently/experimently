"""The docs-journey runner's pytest session (#939).

One test per journey file in ``journeys/``, in the order of their stack and
profile so each stack comes up once. Run it from the repository root, in an
environment with ``tests/acceptance/requirements.txt`` installed and Chromium
installed for Playwright (``python -m playwright install chromium``)::

    DOCS_JOURNEY_RUN_DIR=/tmp/docs-run \\
        python -m pytest -c tests/acceptance/docs/pytest.ini tests/acceptance/docs

This directory is its own pytest root (``pytest.ini``): the repository's root
``conftest.py`` is not loaded, and nothing is imported from the product. The one
thing taken from ``backend`` is the repository's test plugin
``backend/tests/no_real_aws.py`` (pytest and the standard library only), loaded
in ``pytest_configure`` as in every other suite: dummy AWS credentials, no
``~/.aws``, and a failing ``aws`` first on ``PATH``, so nothing a journey starts
can reach an AWS account. ``backend/tests/unit/test_no_real_aws.py`` checks
this root loads it. (It is not ``pytest_plugins`` here: pytest refuses that in
a conftest that is not at the root of the run, as this one is not when a run
starts from ``tests/acceptance``.)

Environment:

* ``DOCS_JOURNEY_RUN_DIR``: where everything the run writes goes (the results
  log ``results.jsonl``, a report per guide as ``<journey>.md`` and
  ``<journey>.html``, ``summary.md``, ``verdicts.json`` (each journey's
  verdict, for ``scripts/docs_journeys_report.py``), the screenshots and
  snapshots, the videos, the launch walkthroughs as
  ``recordings/<name>.webm`` (``recordings.toml``), each stack's output under
  ``stacks/``, and last ``secret-scan.json``). Refused inside the
  repository, so the runner writes nothing into the tree (Python's own
  ``__pycache__`` aside: ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`` keeps that out too;
  marketing-local's build is the other exception, see ``stacks.py``). Unset, a
  new temporary directory, made when a journey first runs and named at the end
  of the run; a session that runs no journey then writes nothing.
* ``DOCS_JOURNEY_RUN_ID``, ``DOCS_JOURNEY_SHA``: written on every log line;
  by default ``GITHUB_RUN_ID`` and ``GITHUB_SHA``, else ``local`` and
  ``unknown`` (no git is run).
* ``DOCS_JOURNEY_RUN_LINK``: the run's link in the report headers; by default
  built from ``GITHUB_SERVER_URL``, ``GITHUB_REPOSITORY`` and
  ``GITHUB_RUN_ID``. The headers are the QA templates only when the commit and
  the link are ones they accept (a run in this repository's Actions);
  otherwise a plain line (``docs_runner/report.py``).
* ``DOCS_JOURNEY_TIMEOUT_MS`` (10000), ``DOCS_JOURNEY_RECORD_VIDEO`` (``1``;
  ``0`` records no video and no walkthrough), ``DOCS_JOURNEY_HEADED`` (``1``
  shows the browser),
  ``DOCS_JOURNEY_KEEP_STACKS`` (``1`` leaves the stacks up at the end).
* The stacks' own settings: ``docs_runner/stacks.py``.

The run directory is uploaded as a public artifact, so when the reports are
written every file in it is read for each value the run made up, kept or
signed in for (``docs_runner/redaction.py``): a file holding one is removed,
with the screenshot beside it and its journey's recording; that journey is
FAIL in the reports and in ``verdicts.json`` (written again, and scanned
again); and the run fails. ``secret-scan.json``, written last, says what was
read and removed. ``docs-journeys.yml`` uploads the directory only when that
record exists and names no removed file, and ``verdicts.json`` only when the
record exists.

A step that cannot run is reported NOT RUN with a reason from
``docs_runner/registry.py``. Nothing here may skip: pytest's skip and xfail are
banned in this directory by ``ruff.toml``, and a run in which any test or
collector was skipped anyway exits 1. A retry plugin is refused at start.
