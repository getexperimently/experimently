"""Load the optional modules into the core application, if present.

This is the only module in ``backend/app`` that knows the ``modules`` package
can exist, and it never imports anything from it by name: it imports the
top-level package and calls its ``register(hooks)`` entry point, which fills in
the hooks in :mod:`backend.app.core.hooks`.  A core build has no ``modules``
package, :func:`load_modules` finds nothing, and every hook keeps its core
default -- that is the core profile.  With the package present and registered
the process runs the full profile.

Called from the four places that build an application or a schema:

* ``backend/app/main.py``       — the running API,
* ``backend/app/db/bootstrap.py`` — ``create_all`` on a fresh database,
* ``backend/app/db/migrations/env.py`` — alembic's ``target_metadata``,
* ``backend/tests/conftest.py`` — the test schema.

Loading is idempotent and never raises: a modules package that fails to import
must not take the core API down with it, so the failure is logged at ERROR --
with the traceback where the traceback carries no secret (see
:func:`describe_exception`), because a full-profile deployment silently
degrading to the core profile is not a state an operator should have to
discover from a 501 -- and the process continues on the core profile.

Mounting what the registration added is part of the same promise and lives here
too (:func:`mount_module_routers`), not in the router build: registering a
router and mounting it are one operation, and both fail the same way.

Degrading *silently* is a development convenience, not a deployment one, so
each caller then says what a failure means for it.  A schema builder refuses
outright (:func:`require_modules_or_absent`), the running API refuses outside
development and test (:func:`abort_if_modules_broken`), and only a core tree
-- no ``modules/`` at all -- is a clean start everywhere.

The entry point is looked for as ``modules.register`` first and
``modules.backend.app.register.register`` second; the package
(``modules/__init__.py``) re-exports the latter as the former.  There is no
other registration path: a tree without ``modules/`` is a core tree.

Two of those four callers build an application and two build a schema, and a
schema needs much less: :func:`require_modules_or_absent` asks for a
registration ``with_routers=False``, which skips the API graph (see
:func:`load_modules`).  A registration that does not accept the keyword is
called exactly as before.

    -- see :func:`require_modules_or_absent` for the callers that must not
    continue on a failure.

    ``with_routers=False`` asks the registration for everything a *schema*
    needs -- the settings, the model modules, the audit signer -- and not for
    the API graph.  Importing the endpoint modules is almost the whole cost of
    a registration (3.5 s here against 0.03 s for the seven model modules), and
    the three schema builders never touch a router.  The request is passed on
    to ``register(hooks, with_routers=...)`` when the registration accepts it;
    one that does not is simply called as before, so a modules package written
    against the older signature still works, just as slowly.

    The cached result records whether the routers were imported, so a later
    ``load_modules()`` -- the running API after a bootstrap, or a test that
    builds the app after ``conftest`` has built the schema -- runs the
    registration again rather than serving no module routes.  Every hook
    registrar is idempotent, so running it twice changes nothing else.  That
    is the *only* reason a cached result is ever recomputed: a load that found
    nothing, or one that failed, still answers from the cache exactly as

    That second run is an *upgrade*, and it is treated as one: a registration
    has already succeeded, so its failure adds nothing and takes nothing away.
    It leaves the state True, leaves the hooks the first run installed alone --
    the audit signer above all -- records the cause, and is not tried again.
    The alternative (what this used to do) was to run it like a first load: on
    failure ``hooks.reset()``, which quietly swapped a real HMAC signer for
    ``NullAuditSigner`` in a process that had been signing compliance events,
    so later events were written with a NULL signature that ``verify()`` calls
    intact while the rows signed *earlier* began to verify False.
