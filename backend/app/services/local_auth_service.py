"""
Local (email + password) authentication -- the default provider.

``AUTH_PROVIDER=local`` authenticates against ``users.email`` /
``users.hashed_password`` (bcrypt, see ``core.security``) and issues HS256
JWTs.  No AWS dependency.

Matching the address
--------------------
The typed address is trimmed and compared with ``lower()`` on both sides, in
the database: ``lower(users.email) = lower(:typed)``.  An account stored as
``Bob@acme.com`` therefore signs in as ``bob@acme.com`` or ``BOB@ACME.COM``,
and the unique index on ``lower(email)`` (``ix_users_email_lower``) both
serves that lookup and keeps two accounts from differing only in case.  An
address that is empty after trimming, contains a NUL character or is longer
than ``MAX_EMAIL_LENGTH`` cannot belong to any account; it is refused with the
same 401 without a database call and is not counted.

Brute-force protection
----------------------
Failed logins are counted per e-mail address, keyed on the same database
``lower()`` the lookup uses, so every spelling that reaches one account
draws on one budget.  After
``LOCAL_AUTH_MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS`` failures inside a rolling window of
``LOCAL_AUTH_LOCKOUT_MINUTES`` the address is locked for the remainder of
that window and ``/auth/login`` answers ``423 Locked``.  A successful login
clears the counter.  A wrong current password on ``POST /users/me/password``
counts against the same address and is locked by the same counter (see
``LocalAuthService.verify_current_password``).

The counter is an **in-process** dictionary.  That is deliberate: it
needs no extra infrastructure and is correct for the default single-worker
container (``WEB_CONCURRENCY=1``).  Deployments running several uvicorn
workers or replicas get an independent counter per worker, so the effective
threshold is ``LOCAL_AUTH_MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS x workers``.  Either accept
that (the per-IP rate limit on ``/api/v1/auth/login`` still applies) or run
a single worker.  Unknown e-mail addresses are counted too, so an attacker
cannot use the 423 as a user-enumeration oracle, and a bcrypt verification
runs against a dummy hash for unknown addresses so response time does not
reveal whether the address exists either.

The tracker sweeps expired windows periodically and caps the number of
tracked addresses, so unauthenticated traffic cannot grow it without bound.
