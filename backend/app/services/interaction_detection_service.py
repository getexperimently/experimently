"""
Experiment Interaction Detection Service.

Two analyses of experiments that run at the same time:

* ``GET /interactions/scan`` (stable) reports the user overlap of every pair
  of active experiments (``scan_active_experiments``).  It does not test
  interactions: its interaction, novelty and SUTVA sub-results are None and
  its risk level comes from the overlap alone.
* ``GET /interactions/{a}/{b}`` (beta, #219) reports the real overlap of two
  experiments and, for each treatment of each one, tests whether its lift on
  the experiment's primary conversion metric differs across the other
  experiment's arms (``analyze_pair_interactions``; the statistics are in
  ``services/interaction_analysis.py``).
