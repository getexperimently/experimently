"""
Record flag evaluations that a server-side SDK made locally.

An SDK evaluating flags in-process makes no ``/feature-flags/evaluate`` call,
so the server writes no ``flag_evaluation`` row for it -- and safety
monitoring divides a flag's reported errors by exactly those rows
(``SafetyService.get_error_metrics``).  With no rows the error rate reads 0.0
and no automatic rollback can fire.  ``POST /api/v1/tracking/evaluations``
closes that gap: the SDK reports per-flag counts and this module turns each
accepted count into one ``RawMetric(flag_evaluation, count=n)`` row, stamped
with the server's receive time so it falls inside the monitor's window at once.

The ceilings
------------
The accepted count is capped, so that a runaway or misconfigured reporter
cannot inflate the denominator without limit:

* at most :data:`KEY_MINUTE_CEILING` per API key, flag and minute;
* at most :data:`FLAG_MINUTE_CEILING` per flag and minute, across every key.

Each cap is a counter row updated by one atomic ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO
UPDATE ... RETURNING``: the row lock serialises concurrent reports for the same
counter across API tasks, and the returned running total says exactly how much
of this report fits.  Nothing reads a counter and then writes it.

When a cap is reached the excess is dropped and reported back in ``errors``.
Dropping evaluations can only make the error rate look *higher* than it is,
which errs towards a rollback rather than away from one.

Locks are taken in one global order (flags sorted by key; for each flag the
per-key row, then the per-flag row), so two reports touching the same flags
cannot deadlock.  Counter rows are pruned a few minutes after their minute,
with ``SKIP LOCKED`` so pruning never waits on, or deadlocks with, a report.
