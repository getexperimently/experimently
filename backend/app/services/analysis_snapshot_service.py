"""
Best-effort persistence of analysis results (``analysis_snapshots``).

The results endpoints call :func:`record_snapshot` after they have computed a
response; the bandit scheduler stages :func:`build_snapshot` rows in its own
transaction.  A snapshot is an audit artefact, not part of the contract with
the caller, so **a failure to write one must never fail the request**: every
error is logged at WARNING and swallowed.

Transaction ownership
---------------------
:func:`record_snapshot` writes in a **short-lived session of its own**, opened
on the caller's engine (``db.get_bind()``) and closed before it returns.  The
request session is never committed or rolled back on its behalf.  This matters
on the read endpoints: ``AnalysisService.compute_bayesian_results`` leaves
``experiment.bayesian_decision`` *flushed but not committed* for the scheduler,
so a ``db.commit()`` from an audit write would silently persist it from a GET,
and the old failure path's ``db.rollback()`` would throw away whatever else the
caller had pending.

One row per experiment, kind and day
------------------------------------
``as_of`` is stored truncated to its UTC calendar day — the same bucket the RNG
seed is derived from in :mod:`backend.app.core.stats_engine`, so a day's
snapshot matches that day's seed — and ``(experiment_id, kind, as_of)`` is
unique.  A dashboard polling ``GET /results/{id}`` every five seconds therefore
keeps one row per kind per day (the latest payload), instead of ~17k rows a
day.  ``updated_at`` records when that row was last refreshed.
