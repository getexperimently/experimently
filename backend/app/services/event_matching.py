"""
Shared rules for recognising conversion events.

Producers disagree on ``Event.event_type``:

* ``EventService.track_conversion`` writes ``event_type="conversion"`` and
  ``event_name=<metric event name>``.
* The public tracking API (``POST /api/v1/tracking/track``/``batch``) and every
  SDK write the event's own name in both columns (``event_type="purchase"``,
  ``event_name="purchase"``) — ``event_type`` is free text there.

A metric is therefore matched on ``event_name`` only; ``event_type`` is used
just to exclude exposure rows.  Every analysis path (results engine, streaming
results, bandit scheduler, segment breakdowns) must use these helpers so the
same event is counted the same way everywhere.

A binary conversion metric counts **converting users**, not conversion events:
a user assigned to a variant who sent one or more matching conversion events
counts once (#233).  ``count_converting_users`` is that one definition, and
every analysis path that reports ``conversions`` next to a ``sample_size`` of
assigned users must use it (or, in raw SQL, ``CONVERTING_USERS_SQL``), so the
numerator can never exceed the denominator.
