"""
Segment membership for flag and experiment targeting (#440).

A targeting condition ``{"attribute": "segment", "operator": "in_segment" |
"not_in_segment", "value": "<segment id>"}`` is answered from membership the
server resolves here, never from the request's context:

* :func:`resolve_segment_memberships` decides, for one user, membership of
  the segments a ruleset references, in at most two queries: one for the
  segments, and one for the id lists among them;
* :func:`with_memberships` puts the answer in the evaluation context under
  :data:`~backend.app.core.rules_engine.SEGMENT_MEMBERSHIP_KEY`, after
  removing whatever the request sent under that name;
* :func:`segment_reference_problem` is the write-time check: every segment a
  ruleset names must exist, be active, and (for a rules segment) have rules
  that pass ``validate_segment_rules``;
* :func:`segment_references` lists the flags and experiments that would stop
  evaluating if a segment were archived or deactivated.

A segment whose membership cannot be decided -- unknown, not active, stored
rules that are not valid, a pattern that cannot be evaluated, or a database
error -- is *unavailable*. A ruleset that references an unavailable segment is
not evaluated: the flag answers ``reason: error`` and the experiment refuses
the user. Answering "not a member" instead would make ``not_in_segment``
match everyone.
