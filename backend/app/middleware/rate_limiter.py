Rate limiting middleware for Experimently.

Provides a Redis-backed rate limiter (fixed-window via INCR + EXPIRE) with
automatic fallback to an in-memory sliding-window limiter when Redis is

class RedisRateLimiter:
    """
    Fixed-window rate limiter backed by Redis ``INCR`` + ``EXPIRE``.

    On any Redis error the limiter falls back to the in-memory
    :class:`SlidingWindowRateLimiter` so that the application keeps serving
    traffic when Redis is unreachable. While it does, the count is per process,
    so a per-IP limit is multiplied by the number of API processes.

    The fallback lasts :data:`REDIS_RETRY_SECONDS`. Inside that window no
    request touches Redis. The first request after it is the retry: it runs the
    real pipeline on the existing client (redis-py reconnects the pool itself),
    or builds and pings a client when the first connect failed. Success returns
    the limiter to Redis; another error starts a new window. A failed first
    connect at startup is simply the first entry into the fallback.

    How long one retry can hold the event loop. The client is built with
    ``retry=Retry(NoBackoff(), 0)``: redis-py's default of ten retries with
    backoff turns one failure into 15-25 s of blocking, which a retry every
    30 s would repeat. With retries off:

    * Redis unreachable: one connect timeout, 2 s.
    * Redis slow but answering: up to 1 s per command (the socket timeout).
    * The no-client branch (connect, ping, pipeline, expire in a row): up to
      about 5 s at the timeout edges.
    * DNS resolution and the TLS handshake are not bounded by either timeout.

    Precondition for "one retry per window per process": ``is_allowed`` is
    synchronous with no ``await`` between the window check and the re-arm, the
    middleware calls it on the event loop thread, and there is one instance
    per process. If the call ever moves to a thread or becomes async, the
    window check and the re-arm need a lock (or an equivalent guarantee).

    Counts at a switch are not carried over. Redis to memory: the in-memory
    window holds only what this process recorded there earlier. Memory to
    Redis: Redis keys keep their TTLs, so counting resumes from what survived.
    Around a transition a client can get up to one Redis budget plus one
    in-memory budget per process in a window.
