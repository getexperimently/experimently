"""Refuse a request whose ``Host`` header is not one of ours.

``Host`` is attacker-controlled on any path that reaches the app, and the app
used to build absolute URLs from it -- the OIDC ``redirect_uri`` among them,
which makes a crafted ``Host`` an authorization-code interception path (#220).
``PUBLIC_BASE_URL`` closes that particular hole by not consulting the request
at all; this closes the general one, for every handler that has not been
audited and every one not yet written.

Why not ``starlette.middleware.trustedhost.TrustedHostMiddleware``: it has no
path exemption, and the ALB's health check sends the TARGET'S OWN IP as
``Host`` (``infrastructure/cdk/stacks/fargate_service_stack.py`` health-checks
``/health``). With Starlette's version and a real ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` the probes
would 400, the target group would never turn healthy, and the deployment would
roll back -- with the app itself perfectly fine. The exemption below is the
whole reason this file exists, so it is written down rather than discovered.

Exempting the probes costs nothing: they are ``include_in_schema=False``
liveness/readiness endpoints that build no URLs and reveal nothing a port scan
would not. ``/metrics`` is exempt for the same reason and is separately
protected by its own token (``backend/app/core/health.py``).
