# Middleware stack
#
# `add_middleware` inserts at the FRONT of `app.user_middleware`, and Starlette
# builds the stack by wrapping in reverse of that list -- so the LAST
# registered call is the outermost layer, not the first. (Measured, not read:
# with CORS registered first and the rate limiter second, `user_middleware`
# prints the rate limiter first, and a 429 it returned never reached CORS.)
#
# CORS is therefore registered last, so every response a middleware below it
# returns -- a 429 from the rate limiter especially -- carries the
# `Access-Control-*` headers a browser needs before it will let the page read
# the status. Without that, a rate-limited login surfaced in the dashboard as
# "Can't reach the API" (#85).

# registration order is what decides the nesting.

# Trailing-slash redirects keep the client's own origin (#86). Registered
# FIRST, i.e. innermost of the layers below, so it is the last thing between
# the router and the response and sees that redirect before anything else can
# act on it. (Starlette still inserts its own ExceptionMiddleware between this
# and the router, so "wraps the router directly" would be too strong.) The
# position is asserted in test_relative_slash_redirect.py, not just claimed.

# Trusted Host — refuse a request whose `Host` is not one of ours (#220).
# `Host` is attacker-controlled on any path that reaches the app, and absolute
# URLs built from it make a crafted one dangerous; `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` already
# removed the OIDC `redirect_uri` from that category, and this covers every
# handler that has not been audited and every one not yet written.
#
# `effective_allowed_hosts`, not `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: with the latter unset it
# derives from PUBLIC_BASE_URL's host, which is the URL users actually reach
# the service at. The earlier attempt at this defaulted to the load balancer's
# own DNS name and would have refused 100% of user traffic while every health
# check stayed green.
#
# Registered AFTER the rate limiter and BEFORE the security headers, putting it
# outside the limiter and inside SecurityHeadersMiddleware. Both halves matter:
#
#   outside the limiter  a forged `Host` costs a header comparison, not a
#                        rate-limit bucket and a database session.
#   inside the headers   its 400 is a response a hostile client is by
#                        construction most likely to see, so it carries the
#                        same headers as everything else -- exactly why the
#                        429 below is positioned the way it is.
#
# The probes are exempt inside the middleware: the ALB health-checks `/health`
# with the TARGET'S OWN IP as `Host`, so without that a correct allow-list
# fails every probe and rolls the deployment back with the app itself healthy.

# Security headers — lightweight and stateless. Registered AFTER the rate
# limiter, i.e. outside it, for the same reason CORS is registered outside
# everything: the limiter returns its 429 without calling `call_next`, so any
# layer nested inside it never runs. With this the wrong way round the 429 —
# the one response on this path a hostile client is most likely to see — went
# out with no `X-Content-Type-Options`, no `X-Frame-Options`, no CSP and, in
# production, no HSTS.

# CORS last, i.e. outermost -- see the note at the top of this block.
#
# A preflight is answered here and goes no further. That is also why it no
# longer spends a request from the login limit, and it is a deliberate
# trade: a preflight response now carries no security headers, no
# `X-Request-ID`, and appears in no Prometheus histogram. A CORS preflight
# has no body and reaches no route, so what is lost is observability of the
# handshake, not of the request it precedes.
