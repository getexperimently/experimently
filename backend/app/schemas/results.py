    Plans a two-sided two-proportion test on the primary metric: the users
    each variant needs to detect a relative lift of ``mde`` over the baseline
    rate.  The baseline is the request's ``baseline_conversion_rate`` or,
    without one, the rate observed in the control variant so far.  Every input
    used is returned with where it came from.

    When there is nothing to plan from yet (no metric, no control users, no
    control conversions) the answer is still 200: the required size and the
    achieved power are ``null`` and ``unavailable_reason`` says why.
