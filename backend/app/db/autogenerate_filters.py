"""
What alembic's autogenerate must leave alone in the core migration chain.

Two kinds of object, for the same reason: they belong to the optional modules,
so the core chain may neither create them nor drop them.

**The two cross-boundary foreign keys.**  The workspaces module's model
(``modules/backend/app/models/workspace.py``) attaches two foreign keys to core
tables -- ``experiments.workspace_id`` and ``feature_flags.workspace_id`` ->
``workspaces.id`` -- whenever the modules' models are loaded.  Those
constraints are managed by the modules' alembic branch
(``modules/backend/app/db/migrations``, issue #89), never by this chain: core
migration ``a7b8c9d0e1f2`` drops them on every database, and the modules
branch's base revision (``modules_0001_rbac``) puts them back.  A full checkout
whose database has not run the branch yet therefore differs from its metadata
by exactly these two, and an autogenerate that emitted them would put a
reference to ``workspaces`` into a core migration, which then fails ``upgrade
heads`` on every core database and silently re-couples the profiles.

**The twelve module tables.**  Nine of them are created by revisions that sit
in the *core* chain for historical reasons (``ep057_workspaces``, ``ep037``,
``ep050``, ``ep034``, ``e181583b4b24``) and three by the modules branch, so a
database can perfectly well hold all twelve while this build's
``Base.metadata`` holds none of them -- a core checkout, or a full checkout
whose registration was asked for core models only.  Since the move under
``modules/`` turned ``include_schemas=True`` on in ``migrations/env.py`` (main
reflects only ``public`` and so never saw them), autogenerate reflects the
application schema and sees them; without this filter it proposes twelve
``op.drop_table`` calls (and their indexes), and applying that revision to a
full-profile database destroys every workspace, SSO configuration, BAA and PHI
audit row.  Reproduced in review round 3: a core checkout, a database with the
module tables, one ``alembic revision --autogenerate``, twelve drops.

The alternative -- rely on the modules being loaded so the tables are in the
metadata -- is what already failed: the loaded profile is a property of the
*process*, and the case that matters is the process that has no modules at all.
A name list is the only thing a core build can answer the question with, so
:data:`MODULE_TABLES` is that list, and
``backend/tests/unit/db/test_autogenerate_filters.py`` pins it against the
MODULE TABLES section of ``modules-manifest.txt`` -- the manifest stays the
source of truth, and the copy here cannot drift from it silently.  (The
manifest itself cannot be read at runtime: ``backend/Dockerfile`` copies
``backend/`` and ``modules/backend/`` into the image and nothing else.)

The filter applies to the core chain only.  A revision generated for the
modules branch -- ``alembic revision --head modules@head`` (or
``--branch-label modules`` for a new base, or a ``--version-path`` under
``modules/``) -- must see the constraints and the tables, because that branch
is exactly where they are managed.  The decision is made from the ``alembic
revision`` command line, never from the profile that happens to be loaded: a
developer on the full profile generating a *core* migration is the common case,
and one that must stay filtered.
