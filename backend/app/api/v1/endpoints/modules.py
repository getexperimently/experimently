Modules endpoint -- ``GET /api/v1/modules``.

Unauthenticated on purpose: it drives the dashboard's chrome (which nav groups
render, which pages are stubs) and the browser has to be able to ask before
anyone has logged in.

Because it is public it exposes only what the chrome needs: the profile, the
installed module names and the version.  Nothing about the deployment's
configuration, secrets or data.
