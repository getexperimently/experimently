    Assign a user to an experiment variant.

    This endpoint assigns a user to a variant of the specified experiment.
    It handles consistent assignment for returning users.

    The assignment is deterministic based on:
    - User ID
    - Experiment ID
    - Targeting rules
    - Traffic allocation percentages

    This means that the same user will always get the same variant assignment
    for a specific experiment, including across experiments in the same mutual
    exclusion group: a user enrolled in one experiment of a group is not
    enrolled in another, even as experiments in the group are activated,
    paused or resumed.

    New users are first checked for eligibility: the global holdout, the
    experiment's mutual exclusion group and its targeting rules (evaluated
    against ``context``; top-level keys also answer ``user.<key>`` /
    ``device.<key>`` / ``app.<key>``).  Ineligible users receive HTTP 200 with
    the control variant, ``assigned: false`` and ``reason`` set to
    ``holdout`` | ``mutual_exclusion`` | ``targeting``; nothing is recorded
    for them.  Existing assignments are always returned as-is.

    **Authentication**: Requires a valid API key in the X-API-Key header.

    Returns:
        VariantAssignmentResponse: The variant assignment with configuration
        details plus ``assigned`` / ``reason``

    Raises:
