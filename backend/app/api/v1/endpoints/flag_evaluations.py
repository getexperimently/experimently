"""
Locally evaluated flag counts (``POST /api/v1/tracking/evaluations``, beta).

A server-side SDK that evaluates flags in-process reports how many evaluations
it made, per flag, so that safety monitoring still has a denominator for the
errors reported through ``POST /api/v1/tracking/errors``.  See
``backend/app/services/sdk_evaluation_service.py`` for how the counts are
stored and capped.

The route requires an API key carrying the ``sdk:ruleset`` scope, the same
scope that grants the local-evaluation ruleset: only a server evaluating flags
locally has anything to report here.  It is mounted under the ``/tracking``
prefix, so it shares the SDK rate limit.

    Record per-flag evaluation counts from an SDK that evaluates flags locally.

    Each accepted count is stored as flag evaluations stamped with the time the

    monitoring counts them towards the flag's error-rate denominator at once.

    Counts are capped per API key, flag and minute (100,000) and per flag and
    minute across all keys (1,000,000); the excess is not recorded and is
    listed in ``errors`` with code ``ceiling``. Unknown flag keys are skipped
