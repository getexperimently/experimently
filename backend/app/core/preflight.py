"""The container's start-up check: every missing or unusable setting, at once.

``backend/docker-entrypoint.sh`` runs ``python -m backend.app.core.preflight``
before anything else -- before it waits for the database, before the
bootstrap, before the server.  It exits 0 when the environment can start, and
otherwise prints one list naming every problem and exits 78 (``EX_CONFIG``).

Without it a staging or production start refused its settings one at a time:
the settings class stops at the first model it cannot build, the modules'
settings are only built after the core ones, and a database URL the image does
not read cost a 120-second wait on ``localhost`` before anything was said.

What it refuses:

* always -- neither ``ENVIRONMENT`` nor the legacy ``APP_ENV`` set, an
  environment name the settings do not know, or ``test``, which is the test
  runner's environment and not one the image runs in.  The image requires
  ENVIRONMENT to be set.  Also an ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` entry that can never match
  (``*example.com``), which the settings refuse in every environment.
* in staging and production -- ``TESTING`` set (the test runner's flag; one
  line, and nothing else is listed, as the settings refuse it outright);
  ``SECRET_KEY``, ``FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD``
  and (full profile) ``AUDIT_HMAC_KEY`` missing, too short or a published
  placeholder; (full profile) ``WAREHOUSE_CREDENTIALS_KEYS`` set but not a
  list of Fernet keys, or holding a placeholder (it may be absent);
  ``PUBLIC_BASE_URL`` missing (unless ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` names the hosts) or
  malformed; ``ALLOWED_HOSTS=*``; ``POSTGRES_SERVER`` (or
  ``POSTGRES_HOST``) not set; ``DATABASE_URL`` or ``DATABASE_URI`` set.

The secret rules are ``settings_rules``', the ones ``config.py`` and the
modules' settings apply, so this refuses what they would refuse -- all of it in
one pass -- plus the database-location mistakes they cannot see.  It never
prints a secret's value.

Standard library plus python-dotenv (a pydantic-settings dependency) only, and
it never imports ``backend.app.core.config``: that module builds the settings
when imported, and raises on the first bad one.
