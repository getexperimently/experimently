"""
Shared identity for the statistics engine: version and seeded randomness.

Every Monte Carlo computation on the platform (Bayesian PtBB / expected loss /
ROPE, Thompson-sampling bandit weights) draws from
``numpy.random.default_rng(seed)`` where ``seed`` is a deterministic function
of the inputs, so two calls with identical inputs return byte-identical
sample arrays and can be audited later.

Seed derivation
---------------
``seed = blake2b(f"{experiment_id}|{as_of_bucket}|{n_samples}", digest_size=8)``
interpreted as a big-endian unsigned integer with the top bit cleared
(63 bits), so it is stable across processes/machines, fits a signed
PostgreSQL ``BIGINT`` and never overflows ``numpy`` seeding.

``as_of_bucket`` is the UTC calendar day (``YYYY-MM-DD``) of the analysis.
The day is the coarsest bucket that is still meaningful for a daily-updated
posterior: every call made on the same day for the same experiment and
sample count reuses the same seed, so dashboards, API consumers and the
persisted ``analysis_snapshots`` agree.

This module lives in ``core`` (not ``services``) so that Pydantic schemas can
import ``ENGINE_VERSION`` without creating an import cycle through
``backend.app.services``.
