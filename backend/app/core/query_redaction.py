"""Query values that are never written to a log line.

uvicorn writes every request to its access log as
``"GET /path?query HTTP/1.1"``, and every WebSocket handshake to
``uvicorn.error`` the same way, query string and all. The API's own request
logging middlewares log a request's query parameters too. Some query values
must not end up in a log:

* every value on the OIDC callback route
  (``/api/v1/auth/sso/oidc/{provider}/callback``): the provider's ``code`` and
  ``state``, and whatever else it appends;
* on any route, the value of a parameter whose name is in
  :data:`REDACTED_QUERY_NAMES` (the OAuth parameters ``code``, ``state``,
  ``token`` and the like, and common spellings such as ``api_key``,
  ``password`` and ``jwt``). The name is compared without regard to case,
  after percent-decoding, so ``CODE`` and ``%63ode`` are matched too.

Each such value is replaced with :data:`REDACTED`; the parameter names are
kept, so a log line still shows which parameters a request carried. Only the
first :data:`MAX_QUERY_CHARS` characters of a query string are looked at, and
the rest is replaced with :data:`TRUNCATED`. The parsing is a split on ``&``
and ``=``: no regular expression, linear in the length of the input.

:func:`configure_logging` (``backend/app/core/logger.py``) installs
:data:`QUERY_VALUE_REDACTOR` on the ``uvicorn.access`` and ``uvicorn.error``
loggers.
