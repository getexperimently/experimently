"""
Targeting rule adapter: dashboard / native rule shapes -> Enhanced Rules Engine.

Feature flag ``targeting_rules`` are stored as JSONB and historically arrived in
three incompatible shapes:

* the **dashboard editor** shape written by the frontend targeting builder::

      {"logical_operator": "AND"|"OR",
       "groups": [{"logical_operator": "AND"|"OR",
                   "conditions": [{"attribute", "operator", "value"}]}]}

  with operators such as ``equals``, ``semver_gte``, ``is_null`` and dotted
  attributes such as ``user.country`` / ``app.version``;
* the **native** :class:`~backend.app.schemas.targeting_rule.TargetingRules`
  shape used by the Enhanced Rules Engine (``{"rules": [...], "default_rule"}``);
* a **legacy list** shape (``[{"type": "user_id"|"context", ...}]``) that
  :class:`~backend.app.services.feature_flag_service.FeatureFlagService`
  evaluates itself.

:func:`normalise_targeting_rules` turns the first two into ``TargetingRules``
and returns ``None`` for the legacy list (or anything it cannot understand) so
the caller keeps its existing behaviour. :func:`expand_context` flattens an SDK
context into the flat lookup dict the engine expects and adds the
``user.<k>`` / ``device.<k>`` / ``app.<k>`` aliases documented in the flag docs.
:func:`match_targeting_rule` finds the first matching rule *without* applying
the engine's own rollout hashing, so the flag service can bucket users with the
flag-level hash exactly as it does for the global rollout percentage.
