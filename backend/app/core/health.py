"""
Health probes and the Prometheus scrape endpoint.

Routes (all unauthenticated, none in the OpenAPI schema):

``GET /health/live``
    Liveness: the process is up and the event loop answers. Never touches the
    database or Redis, so a dependency outage does not make orchestrators
    restart healthy processes. Used by the container ``HEALTHCHECK``.

``GET /health/ready``
    Readiness: PostgreSQL must answer ``SELECT 1``. Redis is checked and
    reported but only fails readiness when ``REDIS_REQUIRED=true`` (the
    application degrades gracefully without Redis: rate limiting falls back to
    memory, caching is skipped). Disk space below 1 GB is reported as ``low``.
    The profile the process runs (``core`` or ``full``) is reported as
    ``profile`` and in ``checks.modules``, and never gates readiness. Returns
    200 when ready, 503 otherwise.

``GET /health``
    Alias of ``/health/ready`` kept for the existing ALB/ECS/CDK wiring.

``GET /metrics``
    Prometheus text exposition. When ``METRICS_TOKEN`` is set the request must
    carry it (``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` or ``?token=<token>``);
    when it is not set the endpoint is open in development/test only and
    returns 403 elsewhere. ``METRICS_ENABLED=false`` disables it (404).

All switches (``METRICS_TOKEN``, ``METRICS_ENABLED``, ``REDIS_REQUIRED``,
``ENVIRONMENT``) are read from ``settings`` (``backend/app/core/config.py``),
which is the single source of truth for the environment.
