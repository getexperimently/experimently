"""
The one rule for reading an API key's ``scopes`` column.

``APIKey.scopes`` is a comma-separated string (``String(255)``, nullable).
Several writers fill it -- the create endpoint, which normalises, and the demo
and contract seed scripts, which write literals such as ``"read,write"`` -- so
every reader goes through :func:`parse_scopes`:

* split on ``","``;
* strip surrounding whitespace from each entry;
* drop empty entries.

Membership (:func:`has_scope`) is exact and case-sensitive on the parsed
entries: ``"sdk:ruleset"`` is granted by ``"read, sdk:ruleset "`` but not by
``"SDK:RULESET"``, ``"xsdk:ruleset"`` or ``"sdk:ruleset-ro"``. There is no
prefix, wildcard or substring matching.

This module only parses. Whether a route requires a scope is decided where the
route is declared (``backend/app/api/sdk_scope.py`` for ``sdk:ruleset``).
