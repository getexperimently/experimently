"""
Whether each analysis's numbers can be relied on: ``ga`` or ``beta``.

This is the one table behind the ``analysis_status`` and ``analysis_notice``
fields of the analysis responses.  It is about the *numbers*, and is separate
from a route's ``x-stability`` (``docs/api/stability.md``), which is about the
*shape* of the request and response.

* ``ga``: the analysis computes what its fields say; ``analysis_notice`` is null.
* ``beta``: part of the analysis is not computed yet, or not computed from what
  its name says; ``analysis_notice`` says which part, and links the issue.

A notice is present exactly when the status is ``beta``: the table refuses any
other combination when this module is imported.  Responses read the table when
they are built, never a copy of it, so changing an entry here changes every
response that carries it.
