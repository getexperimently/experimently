"""The one place the running code learns its own version.

``VERSION`` at the repository root is the single source: ``release-please``
maintains it (``release-please-config.json``), ``pyproject.toml`` reads it
through setuptools' ``dynamic`` version, the images copy it to ``/app/VERSION``
and label themselves from it, and ``settings.VERSION`` — and so ``/health`` and
``GET /api/v1/modules`` — resolve it here.

Three resolution steps, in order, because the code runs in three shapes:

1. **A checkout or an image.**  ``VERSION`` sits at the root of the tree, three
   directories above this file (``backend/app/core/version.py``), and the API
   image reproduces that layout under ``/app``.  This is the normal path.
2. **An installed distribution.**  ``pip install experimently-platform`` puts
   ``backend/`` into ``site-packages`` and leaves ``VERSION`` behind, so the
   recorded distribution metadata answers instead.  It was built *from* the
   same file, so the two agree by construction.
3. **Neither.**  A source tree with the file deleted, or a partial copy.
   ``0.0.0+unknown`` — a valid PEP 440 version that no release can collide
   with, so a deployment reporting it is visibly unreleased rather than
   plausibly wrong.

Deliberately *not* a ``try: import`` of some generated ``_version.py``: a
generated file is a second source that can disagree with the first, and the
whole point of this module is that there is one.
