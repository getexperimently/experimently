"""
Core-side accessors for the optional modules' capabilities.

Core code must never import the ``modules`` package directly.  Where a core
route or service needs to *reach* a module's capability when that module
happens to be installed, it asks this module, which looks the capability up in
``backend.app.core.hooks`` by key.  Every accessor returns ``None`` in a build
that has not registered the capability, and each caller answers that with an
explicit HTTP 501 -- never with silence.  501 means exactly one thing: this
deployment does not have the module installed.

The keys are the contract with ``modules.register(hooks)``
(``modules/backend/app/register.py``):

``split_url.routing``
    The routing function itself.  Read through
    :func:`split_url_routing_available`, which gates *creation* of
    ``experiment_type=split_url`` -- without routing, a core-profile user
    could store a split-URL experiment that nothing ever routes.

``split_url.preview``
    The body of ``GET /experiments/{id}/split-url/preview``.

``compliance.report`` / ``compliance.export``
    The bodies of ``GET /compliance/reports/{standard}`` and
    ``GET /compliance/export``.  ``GET /compliance/audit-events`` is core and
    is NOT brokered here.

``counters.service``
    A **provider**: a zero-argument callable answering the
    ``DynamoDBCounterService`` class -- the first of ``BanditScheduler``'s
    four stats sources -- resolved at each call rather than captured at
    registration, so the class is whatever the service module holds *now*
    (which is what lets a test patch it at its definition site).  Absent, the
    scheduler simply falls through to PostgreSQL.
