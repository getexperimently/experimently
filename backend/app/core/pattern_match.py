"""
Pattern conditions (the ``regex`` / ``match_regex`` operator), evaluated with RE2.

Every stored or request-supplied pattern is compiled and searched here and
nowhere else; ``backend/tests/unit/core/test_regex_call_sites.py`` fails on a
call into :mod:`re` whose pattern is not a literal or a module constant.

Syntax and semantics are RE2's (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax),
which differ from Python's :mod:`re` in ways a stored pattern can notice:

* ``\\w``, ``\\d``, ``\\s`` and ``\\b`` are ASCII-only (use ``\\p{L}``,
  ``\\p{N}`` or ``[[:alpha:]]`` for other scripts);
* ``$`` matches only at the very end of the value, not before a final newline;
* lookaround, backreferences, ``\\Z``, ``(?x)``, ``(?u)``, ``(?a)`` and
  ``\\N{...}`` are refused, as is a counted repetition above 1000;
* a pattern that needs more than :data:`PATTERN_MEMORY_BYTES` to compile is
  refused (``pattern too large``), which includes very large Unicode
  repetitions such as ``[\\p{L}\\p{N}]{1,300}``.

A condition whose pattern is refused, or whose value is longer than
:data:`MAX_REGEX_INPUT` characters or cannot be encoded as UTF-8, is
*unevaluable*. :func:`search` then raises :class:`PatternUnevaluable`, and
the evaluator that owns the ruleset abandons the whole ruleset for that
evaluation (a flag is disabled with reason ``error``, a user is ineligible for
an experiment, a user is not a segment member). It is never reduced to
``False`` inside a group, where an enclosing ``NOT`` would turn it into a
match.
