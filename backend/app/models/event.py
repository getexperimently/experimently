    is a string comparison.  That only orders correctly when every value is in
    UTC and in the same shape, so every value is converted to UTC and written
    the way ``datetime.isoformat()`` writes an aware UTC datetime:
    ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00``, or ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff+00:00``
    when there are microseconds.  Those two shapes still sort in time order
    ('+' sorts before '.', and a value with no fraction is the earlier one),
    and they are what the server has always written for its own timestamps,
    so rows written that way compare correctly with new ones.  A value with
    no offset is taken to be UTC already.

    Accepts a ``datetime`` or an ISO-8601 string (``Z`` or a numeric offset).
    Raises ``ValueError`` for anything else, so an unreadable timestamp is
    refused rather than stored and compared as text.
