"""
Global Holdout model for keeping a percentage of new users out of every
experiment (EP-022, #445).

While a holdout is active, ``POST /api/v1/tracking/assign`` answers a new user
the holdout buckets with the control variant and no assignment.  Feature flags
and split-URL experiments ignore it.

Who a holdout covered is recorded in ``holdout_population``
(``backend/app/models/holdout_population.py``), so the held-out users can be
compared with everyone else first seen while it was active.  That comparison
needs three things this model carries:

* ``hash_salt``: each holdout buckets users with its own salt, so the users one
  holdout kept out are not the same users the next one keeps out.  A new row
  gets ``holdout:<random token>`` from the Python default below.  The legacy
  salt ``global_holdout_v1`` is the server default, kept only so an older image
  after a rollback can still insert a row; a holdout with the legacy salt is
  never measurable.
* ``activated_at`` / ``deactivated_at``: when it started and ended.  Both are
  set by ``GlobalHoldoutService`` and never cleared; an ended holdout cannot
  restart.
* a partial unique index on ``is_active`` ``WHERE is_active``: at most one
  active holdout, enforced by the database.
