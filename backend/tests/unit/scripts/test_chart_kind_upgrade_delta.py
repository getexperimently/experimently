"""chart-kind's N-1 -> N delta reads this PR's revisions before N-1 is pulled.

``scripts/chart_kind.sh upgrade-previous`` asserts that the migrate containers
applied exactly the revisions this PR's image has and N-1's does not.  N-1 is
usually the release ``VERSION`` names, so its image tag, ``<profile>-<prev>``,
is the very tag ``load`` gave this PR's image (``<profile>-<appVersion>``).
``docker pull`` moves that tag to N-1's image.  When "this PR's revisions" were
read through the tag after the pull, they were N-1's own, the delta was empty
however many migrations the PR added, and the first PR to add one (#343) failed
with "the migrate containers applied [d12cbd384bbe], the delta is []".

The cluster job is the real gate; this pins the order it depends on, without a
cluster: this PR's revisions come from the image ID ``load`` recorded, read
before the first ``docker pull``, and nothing reads them through the tag.
