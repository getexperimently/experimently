"""chart-kind's N-1 falls back one release while the newest one's images publish.

Right after a release its tag exists minutes before release.yml has published
its images. ``scripts/chart_kind.sh previous`` used to resolve N-1 to that tag
regardless, the upgrade leg's pull failed, and main went red until the images
existed (#519). Now ``previous`` reads each candidate's two images (this
profile's api and dashboard) from GHCR anonymously, and:

* the newest tag at or below VERSION is published -> N-1 is that tag;
* it is not -> N-1 is the release before it, with a warning and a line in the
  job summary saying which and why;
* neither is -> the job fails (a package that is no longer public reads as
  "manifest unknown" too, so the fallback goes one step and no further);
* a PREVIOUS_VERSION given by name is never replaced.

Run as shell, the script's own functions extracted, with ``git`` and
``docker`` stubbed: no registry and no cluster.
