"""Tamper evidence for `scripts/leak_guard.py`.

Every rule is planted against and watched to fire. A gate that has only ever
been seen to pass is not a gate, and this repository has shipped several that
passed for the wrong reason -- a `find` matching a directory instead of the
page it guarded, a CI input that selected nothing, a grep that arrived
double-escaped and matched nothing for ever.

The two tests that matter most are the last two:

  * a clean TREE whose commit MESSAGE leaks must still be rejected. That is
    the exact shape of the incident this guard replaces -- the old export
    sweep read files only, reported PASS, and published sixteen commit
    messages containing an absolute home path.

  * an offender planted IN the guard's own source must be caught BY the guard.
    The predecessor excluded `scripts/publish/` from its own grep and
    therefore published the AWS account id printed on line 276 of the very
    script that forbade it.
