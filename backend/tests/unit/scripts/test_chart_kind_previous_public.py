"""chart-kind's N-1 -> N leg runs on every event and pulls N-1 anonymously.

While the GHCR packages were private, ``scripts/chart_kind.sh previous`` printed
"not run: images private until D19" on a pull request from a fork and the
workflow skipped the leg. The packages are public now (#227), so the leg runs
everywhere, and it fails closed: a pull that cannot be made without
credentials fails the job with a message naming the likely cause, on every
event -- not only on forks, which is where a package that went private again
would otherwise first show up.

The cluster job is the real gate; this pins, without a cluster or a registry:

* the workflow's upgrade step has no ``if:`` and the job logs in to no
  registry;
* ``previous`` resolves N-1 for a pull request from a fork exactly as for any
  other event (run as shell, with ``git`` stubbed);
* ``pull_anonymously`` exits non-zero with the message when ``docker pull``
  fails, and sends no stored credential when it succeeds (run as shell, with
  ``docker`` stubbed).
