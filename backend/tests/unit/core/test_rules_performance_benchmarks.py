"""
Cost properties and latency benchmarks for the enhanced rules engine.

Two kinds of test live here, and the split is the point (#409).

``TestRulesEvaluationCost`` runs in every suite. It asserts the deterministic
property each latency number used to stand in for: how many conditions an
evaluation looks at, that the first matching rule ends the search, that the
validator visits each rule once, that concurrent evaluations agree with
sequential ones. Those are counts, so a slow or overloaded runner cannot fail
them and a genuinely more expensive engine cannot pass them.

``TestRulesLatencyBenchmarks`` keeps the absolute ceilings (average and p95
milliseconds, evaluations per second). It is marked ``benchmark`` and skipped
unless ``RUN_BENCHMARKS=1`` (see backend/tests/benchmark_gate.py): an absolute
number measures the machine as much as the code. Each ceiling is taken over
the fastest of several rounds, as ``timeit`` does, so even there one stalled
moment does not decide the result.

What used to be here: ``test_single_rule_performance`` asserted a single
measured average (``< 1 ms``) and p95 (``< 5 ms``) over 100 evaluations, in the
required unit suite. It failed #395's Backend Gate with nothing in that pull
request touching the rules engine, and every other test in this file had the
same shape.
