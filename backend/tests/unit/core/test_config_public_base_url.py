"""PUBLIC_BASE_URL parsing and validation (#220).

The shape rules are not cosmetic. This value is concatenated with
``/api/v1/auth/sso/oidc/{provider}/callback`` to form an OIDC ``redirect_uri``,
and an IdP matches that against its registration EXACTLY -- so a trailing
slash or a stray path is a callback the IdP refuses, which surfaces as "SSO is
broken" rather than as a configuration error.
