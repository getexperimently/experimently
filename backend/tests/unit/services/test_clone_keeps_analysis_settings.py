"""A cloned experiment keeps its analysis settings (#255).

``ExperimentService.clone_experiment`` copied the name, rules, variants and
metrics, but not the analysis settings: a clone of an experiment with Bayesian
analysis, sequential testing or CUPED came back with all three off. Now every
setting in ``CLONED_ANALYSIS_FIELDS`` is copied, each JSON value deep-copied so
the clone and its source never share a dict.

The last test classifies every column of ``Experiment``: a new column fails it
until it is named as one a clone copies or one it deliberately does not.

The same clone against a database, through the API, is in
``backend/tests/integration/api/test_clone_keeps_analysis_settings.py``.
