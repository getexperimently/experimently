"""What the bootstrap says when a database records a revision it has no file for.

Two builds can meet such a database, and they need different answers (#238):

* a **core** build opened against a database the **full** profile migrated --
  the unresolvable rows are all ``modules_*`` revisions;
* an **older** build opened against a database a **newer release** migrated --
  a rollback.  The unresolvable row is a core-chain id this build has never
  seen (or a modules revision a full build has no file for).

The refusal used to diagnose every case as the first, and told the reader to
delete the rows "with a backup taken".  On a rolled-back database that is
harmful: the newer release's tables stay, alembic forgets they are there, the
next run re-applies migrations over them and the next upgrade dies on
``DuplicateTable``.  So neither message may advise removing rows, and each must
name its own diagnosis.

No database: :func:`may_run_alembic` decides from the recorded revision ids and
the revision files on disk.  The end-to-end version, with a real planted
revision and the bootstrap run as a subprocess, is
``backend/tests/integration/database/test_newer_database_rollback.py``.
