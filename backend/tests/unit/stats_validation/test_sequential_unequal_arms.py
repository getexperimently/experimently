"""The sequential interval keeps its coverage when arms are split unequally (#854).

``GET /results/{id}/sequential`` decides ``can_stop`` with the mSPRT and
reports the confidence sequence that inverts it, so 0 lies outside the interval
exactly when ``can_stop`` is true.  Both used the plug-in variance
``p(1-p)/n`` per arm until #854.  With a small, low-rate arm that variance is
too small (it is 0 while the arm has no conversions), so the interval was too
narrow and, by the identity above, A/A experiments were stopped too often: at
9:1 and a 1% rate about one in five A/A paths was told ``stop_for_effect``.
Since #854 both use the Agresti-Caffo variance.

Each cell simulates ``PATHS`` experiments read ``LOOKS`` times, with ``M``
users per look in the small arm and ``M * ratio`` in the large one, through
``SequentialTestingService`` itself.  The seed is fixed, so the counts below
are deterministic; the floors are the nominal level, 1 - alpha = 0.95.
Measured at this seed (coverage / share of A/A paths that ever stop):

Agresti-Caffo is not exact at every design: with a far smaller arm (99:1)
and 10 to 50 users per look in it, coverage measured 0.93 to 0.95
(``docs/api/sequential-testing.md`` states this).

The 1:1 coverage and A/A gates stay in ``test_sequential_confidence_sequence.py``.
