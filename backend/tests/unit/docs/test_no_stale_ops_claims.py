"""Operator-facing text no longer says things the code and the deploy path do not do.

Each phrasing below was true once, or never, and was removed (#768, #792, #798):

* **"Restore the snapshot the deploy took before migrating."** The rollback
  runbook undoes a migration while the release that contains it is serving,
  before the API is rolled back; the emergency route is a point-in-time
  restore to a new cluster.
* **"Restore IN PLACE."** Neither Aurora restore (point-in-time or from a
  snapshot) keeps the original cluster; both create a new one.
* **"Not yet run against a real AWS account."** The forward Deploy has run to
  success on staging.
* **The issue chooser's link to Discussions.** Discussions are turned off on
  the repository, so the link answered 404.
* **The frontend Dockerfile's "the published site" default.** An empty
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL` sends the dashboard's docs links to the Markdown on
  GitHub (`frontend/src/services/docs.ts`).
* **The conftest "regardless of POSTGRES_PORT".** It reads `POSTGRES_PORT`.

This is a sweep, not a proof: it forbids the removed phrasings (and close
variants), so a sentence restored by a bad merge fails here with the file and
line. A new wording of the same false claim is not caught; review is.

Reads only files; no git, so it runs the same in `scripts/core_build.sh`'s
copy, which has no `.git`.
