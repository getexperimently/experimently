"""The demo guides describe the bandit panel the dashboard has, not a chart it never had.

`demo/DEMO_GUIDE.md` (Scene 4) and `demo/shoplab/README.md` (product sort)
told a presenter to open a "Bandit view", show an "allocation history chart"
and "watch the live updates". None of those existed. A bandit experiment's
page now has one read-only panel, "Current traffic weights", that loads once
and on Refresh and shows no history (#442).

Two checks:

* a sweep over the demo guides, every page under `docs/` and the README for
  the phrasings that were removed (and close variants). It is a sweep, not a
  proof: a new wording of the same claim is review's job;
* both demo guides name the panel by the heading the dashboard renders, read
  from the component's source, so renaming either side fails here.

Reads only files; no git, so it runs the same in `scripts/core_build.sh`'s
copy. It is in the docs-only gate's "Docs content tests" through its
directory, `backend/tests/unit/docs/`.
