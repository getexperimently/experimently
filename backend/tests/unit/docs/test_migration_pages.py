"""The two migration pages and the load-testing page, as Doc Examples runs them (#1075).

``docs/self-hosting/migrations.md`` is the operator's page: its reader has the
image, not a checkout, so every command it runs goes into the API container
(``docker compose exec api ...``) and runs in the ``stack`` environment.
``docs/development/database/migrations.md`` and
``docs/performance/load-testing.md`` are the contributor's pages, run from a
development virtual environment in ``stack-dev``, which carries those two
only. What a run cannot see is pinned here, without a stack:

* the operator page runs nothing from a venv, and its AWS block runs the
  migration task the way the Deploy workflow does: a registered revision's
  ARN, never the bare family, with ``MIGRATION_COMMAND``;
* no shell block on either migration page autogenerates a revision without
  naming the head it extends, or names the singular ``head``: a full checkout
  has two heads (the contributor page once told a reader to autogenerate an
  "Initial migration" on an empty database, with neither).
