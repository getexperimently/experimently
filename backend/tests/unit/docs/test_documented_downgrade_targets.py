"""No documented downgrade target silently crosses a column-dropping downgrade (#580).

The self-hosting migrations page, the rollback runbook and the Database
Migration workflow's help each name a revision id to downgrade to: the
``1ab99332f0ba`` re-run recipe (``downgrade a89544fb1075``, then ``upgrade
heads``) and the "undo the latest release's migration" example. A downgrade
to a fixed id unapplies every revision above it. So the day a new revision
lands on top of the documented target, the same command also runs the new
revision's ``downgrade()`` -- and if that drops a column, the recipe now
deletes stored data, while the page still says it "changes no data".

This asks alembic's own planner, with no database, which revisions each
documented target unapplies from the current heads, and reads each of those
revisions' ``downgrade()`` through ``ast`` for a ``drop_column`` call. A
crossing passes only when the part of the document that names the target
(its heading section, or for the workflow its line) also names the
column-dropping revision, with "drop", "drops", "dropped" or "dropping"
within 200 characters of the id: the recipe has to say so where an operator
reads it, not cite the revision for some other reason.

When this fails, fix the documents (the target, or a sentence naming the
revision and what its downgrade drops), never this file.
