"""The documentation of segment targeting (#440).

* the three operator references (``docs/api/endpoints.md``,
  ``docs/feature-flags/create.md``, ``docs/Enhanced_Rules_Engine_Reference.md``)
  carry the same ``in_segment`` / ``not_in_segment`` paragraph, and the two
  operator lists name both operators;
* the paragraph states the fail-closed rule, not "not a member";
* the rollback runbook says to disable segment-targeted flags AND pause
  segment-targeted experiments, before a rollback past segment targeting and
  after an automatic one, and names the ``/sdk/ruleset`` leg and the SDKs'
  cached rulesets;
* no segment page says a segment "matches every user".
