"""The integration pages describe the integrations API the code serves.

The GitHub and Salesforce pages, the FAQ and the endpoint list described an
integration the API does not have, and a webhook that answers differently from
what they said. On main (`modules/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/integrations.py`,
`modules/backend/app/schemas/integration.py`):

* An integration is addressed by its **type**, in lower case:
  `/api/v1/integrations/{integration_type}` with `jira`, `salesforce` or
  `github`. There is no id in a path, and `integration_type` in a body is lower
  case too (`"GITHUB"` is a 422).
* The body field is `encrypted_config`. A `"config"` field is not an error: it is
  ignored, so an example that sent one answered 200 and changed nothing.
* Reading is ADMIN or DEVELOPER; creating, updating and deleting is ADMIN.
* A webhook answers `{"status": "received"}` for an authenticated delivery, never
  `{"processed": true}`. Every refused delivery is one 401 (a wrong or missing
  signature included); a 400 only follows a successful authentication.
* The Salesforce webhook takes a JSON object from a Flow HTTP Callout, an Apex
  callout or a relay. A native Salesforce Outbound Message sends SOAP/XML with no
  custom headers: with no header it is a 401, and with the header added by a
  proxy the XML body is a 400. So no page may say an outbound message uses or
  can set the shared-secret header.
* Nothing in the platform calls Jira, Salesforce or GitHub, and an
  authenticated delivery changes nothing: the pages said the platform synced
  both ways, pushed results to Salesforce campaigns and linked pull requests to
  experiments. `modules/backend/tests/unit/services/test_integration_wiring.py`
  fails when a call is wired, so the pages and this test change with it.

This test forbids the phrasings that were removed and requires the pages to say
what is true. It is a sweep, not a proof: a new wording of the same claim is not
caught; review is. Each forbidden pattern also has a sample it must match, so a
pattern that has silently stopped matching fails here instead of reporting
"clean" for ever. When the API changes, change the docs and this test together.

Reads only files; no git and no `modules` import, so it runs the same in
`scripts/core_build.sh`'s copy (no `.git`, no `modules/`). It names no module
path (the core/modules boundary test forbids it): the module docstrings that
describe the webhooks are swept with these same rules by
`modules/backend/tests/unit/services/test_integration_docstrings.py`. It is in
the docs-only gate's "Docs content tests" through its directory,
`backend/tests/unit/docs/`.
