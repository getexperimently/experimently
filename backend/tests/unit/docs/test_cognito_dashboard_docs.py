"""Every docs page that presents Cognito mode says the dashboard cannot sign in under it (#644).

Under ``AUTH_PROVIDER=cognito`` the dashboard's sign-in form posts to
``/api/v1/auth/login``, which answers 404, and an SSO sign-in issues a token
the Cognito provider refuses.  Until that changes (#708, #707) every page that
presents Cognito mode carries the same three sentences, :data:`NOTE`:

* the dashboard does not yet sign in with Cognito -- the sentence onboarding
  step 5 of ``docs/cognito_integration.md`` already uses, not a variant;
* sign in through the API with ``POST /api/v1/auth/token``;
* SSO sign-in needs ``AUTH_PROVIDER=local``.

The pages are DISCOVERED, not listed: any file under ``docs/`` (the generated
OpenAPI snapshots aside) that names ``AUTH_PROVIDER=cognito`` or carries a
"Cognito only" box must carry the note, so a new page that presents Cognito
fails here until it says so.  The note itself does not name
``AUTH_PROVIDER=cognito``, so deleting it cannot take a page out of the set.

Pinned without a database or the app (this runs on a docs-only pull request).
Walks the filesystem rather than asking git, so it also runs in the
``core_build.sh`` copy, which has no ``.git``.
