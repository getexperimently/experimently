"""Each SDK page says whether CI runs its contract smoke against a real API (#1075).

The SDK pages carried hand-dated lines such as "Verified against a live
backend: yes (2026-09-11)", held to nothing, and five of them disagreed with
what CI runs. Each page now carries one undated sentence in one of two forms:

    CI runs this SDK's contract smoke against a real API: `<sdk>` is in the
    `sdks:` list of the SDK Live Contract job in pr-qa-gate.yml.

    CI does not run this SDK's contract smoke against a real API: `<sdk>` is
    not in the `sdks:` list of the SDK Live Contract job in pr-qa-gate.yml.

This test holds those sentences to that list, read by parsing
``.github/workflows/pr-qa-gate.yml`` (the list is a folded ``>-`` string, one
YAML value, not lines a search could rely on):

* every page under ``docs/sdk/`` except ``NOT_AN_SDK_PAGE`` carries at least
  one sentence, and none carries the old "Verified against a live backend";
* every SDK a sentence names is a ``--sdk`` name of the live runner,
  ``tests/sdk-contract/live/run_live_contract.py`` (its ``MANIFEST``, read
  with ``ast``), and no SDK is named twice;
* a "runs" sentence names an SDK in the job's list, a "does not run" sentence
  one that is not, and every SDK in the list has a "runs" sentence.

The SDK READMEs under ``sdk/`` carried the same dated line: none may carry it
now, and a README's sentence is held to the same list.

Line breaks inside a sentence do not matter: each page's whitespace is folded
before matching. Reads only files; no git, so it runs the same in
``scripts/core_build.sh``'s copy. It is in the docs-only gate's "Docs content
tests" through its directory, ``backend/tests/unit/docs/``.
