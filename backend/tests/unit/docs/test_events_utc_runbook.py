"""The operator's section for ``1ab99332f0ba``, which rewrites event times (#579).

The revision rewrites stored ``events.created_at`` values to UTC.  Its section
of the self-hosting migrations page is what an operator follows before, during
and after the upgrade, so this pins, without a database (it runs on a
docs-only pull request):

* the section exists under a heading whose anchor the page's two links use (the
  generic reversibility note and the rollback bullet);
* both SQL statements in it select with the migration's own candidate
  predicate, character for character -- the count before the upgrade and the
  list after it would otherwise disagree with what the migration did;
* the log line it quotes has the shape the revision prints;
* the re-run recipe names ``a89544fb1075`` and never ``-1`` or ``^``;
* it says the downgrade cannot restore the offsets, to snapshot first, and not
  to kill a long run, per deployment.

Whether that SQL selects exactly the migration's candidates is run against
PostgreSQL by
``backend/tests/integration/database/test_events_created_at_utc_migration.py``,
which reads the blocks through :func:`sql_blocks` here.
