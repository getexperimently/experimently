"""`docs/getting-started/quick-start.md` — the claims its examples depend on.

Until the documentation runner executes the page (Stream D), these pin what can
be checked without a stack:

* Step 7 creates its flag switched off, so the `/activate` that follows is a
  real step rather than a no-op on a flag that was already on;
* Step 7 evaluates `user-2`, and the page says `user-2` is inside the 10%
  rollout and `user-123` is not.  That is decided by the service's bucketing,
  so it is asserted through the service: a change to the hash fails here, with
  this message, instead of as a quick-start that quietly prints `false`;
* no shell example carries a `#` comment.  macOS's default zsh does not treat
  `#` as a comment when a line is pasted (`interactivecomments` is off), so
  `... | jq .status  # "healthy"` hands `#` and `"healthy"` to `jq` as file
  names and fails (#98).  Expected values belong in the prose.
