"""The workflow role's permissions follow the workflows (#140, PE v1 C12).

`scripts/iam_actions.py` derives the IAM actions from every `aws <service>
<verb>` in deploy.yml, rollback.yml, db-migrate.yml, the local actions and the
scripts they run. The committed policy and the documented table must be what it
generates, so a workflow that gains a call fails here until the role is given
it -- instead of failing, mid-deploy, with AccessDenied.

The trust policy is pinned to GitHub's immutable subject for this repository
and one environment (PE v1 C5): the old one allowed `repo:<name>:*`, i.e. any
branch, any pull request workflow, and a repository nobody owns any more.
