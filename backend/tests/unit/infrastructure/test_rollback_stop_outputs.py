"""The rollback's stop step records what it stopped and how its wait ended (#759).

Two outputs of rollback.yml's "Stop any deployment already in flight":

* ``stopped``: every id the step has asked CodeDeploy to stop, space-separated,
  in listing order, written as a whole BEFORE each ``stop-deployment``. A stop
  call that fails ends the step under ``set -e`` with its id already written.
* ``stop_wait``: ``ok``, ``timeout`` or ``unreadable``, written exactly once,
  inside the end state it names. Absent, with ``stopped`` set, when a stop
  call failed.

Neither is written when the step never reached a stop call (nothing in
flight, refused, the first listing failed).

The step runs under ``bash -e``, what GitHub's runner uses (``shell:
/usr/bin/bash -e {0}`` in both captured runs' logs), through
test_dashboard_deploy_wiring's ``Runner``: a fake ``aws`` first on PATH, no
credentials, a no-op ``sleep``. The fake copies GITHUB_OUTPUT at each stop
call (``Runner.snapshots()``), which is the only way to tell a write before
the call from a write after it, and ``Runner.raw_outputs`` keeps the file as
written, which is the only way to see a key written twice.

The two captured runs are fixtures under ``fixtures/rollback_runs/``; each
says which of its answers are verbatim from the log and which are
reconstructed from the step's own messages.
