"""`scripts/ecs_rolling_rollout.sh`: a circuit-breaker rollback is never a success.

The dashboard is an ECS rolling-update service with the deployment circuit
breaker and rollback on. `aws ecs wait services-stable` succeeds when there is
one deployment and the service's running count equals its desired count -- which
is exactly the state after the breaker has put the OLD revision back. So the
script decides on the PRIMARY deployment this run started (C4 plan-v2, EM v1
condition 3, PE v1 C3 and C12):

* this run's deployment id, as `update-service` returned it, must be listed
  once before any verdict (ECS is eventually consistent);
* after that, a PRIMARY on another revision fails at once, and the id no
  longer being listed fails;
* success is one deployment, ours, PRIMARY on our revision, COMPLETED, with
  the DEPLOYMENT's own running == desired >= 1;
* desiredCount < 1 and a PRIMARY other than `--expect-primary` are refused
  before `update-service` is called.

The cases are R1-R9 and R11 of the plan (R10 is the API half of the race guard,
which C4's workflow wiring owns). Each is driven with a fake `aws` first on PATH
that serves a scripted sequence of `describe-services` answers (the first is the
pre-mutation read; the last repeats). Every run uses `--interval 0`; a case
that must reach the deadline uses `--deadline 0`; the others use a 3 s
deadline, so a classifier that never decides fails on an assertion (its outcome
and a bounded `describe-services` count), not on a timeout. A 10 s safety net
fails by name if `--deadline` itself is unenforced. Nothing asserts on elapsed
time.
