"""Whose X-Forwarded-* the server believes (#237).

``--forwarded-allow-ips="*"`` told uvicorn to believe everybody's. That is not
a small setting: it decides both ``scope["scheme"]`` and ``scope["client"]``,
and the rate limiter keys its buckets on the latter, so it decided whether a
client could mint itself an unlimited budget against the strict login limit.

The second test here drives the REAL uvicorn that is pinned in
``backend/requirements.txt`` rather than asserting what its documentation says
it does. That distinction has mattered in this repository more than once: a
flag does not do what its name suggests until it has been run and looked at.
