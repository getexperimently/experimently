"""A rollback ends with one verdict line, chosen by a written precedence table (#759).

``scripts/rollback_verdict.py`` decides the verdict of a Rollback run in one
place, ``decide()``: an ordered list of rows, the first matching row wins,
row 0 refusing any input outside its set. rollback.yml's "Run summary" step
gathers the inputs and prints the headline the script writes; it exits 0 only
for ROLLED BACK.

Two kinds of test, as the plan chose (verdict-759 plan v2, section 4):

* **The whole table through ``decide()``.** ``fixtures/rollback_verdict/cells.json``
  holds every reachable cell (538) and the 11 out-of-set cells, each with its
  expected verdict word and row. It is the output of the plan's prototype,
  which is independent of ``decide()``: the expected words are data, not a
  copy of the precedence logic.
* **The summary step itself**, run as the runner runs it (``bash -e``, a fake
  ``aws`` first on PATH, no credentials), once per row, per named overlap, per
  ``stop_wait`` value end to end, the guard, and the case where every read
  fails. Each asserts the WHOLE headline, a literal written from the plan's
  section 3, never a substring ("ROLLED BACK" is inside "NOT ROLLED BACK").
