"""Each pull request has its own concurrency group, and a run that an edit or a
label starts is never cancelled (B1, B3; #75, #399).

A concurrency group is repository-wide. Two runs in one group with
``cancel-in-progress: true`` means the older is cancelled, so the group must
name the pull request. ``github.head_ref`` does not: it is the bare branch
name, and two forks that each edit a file in the web editor both push
``patch-1``. Seven workflows keyed on it (``head_ref`` alone, or
``head_ref || github.ref``, which short-circuits to ``head_ref`` on a pull
request), so the second contributor's push cancelled the first one's checks.

B1 does not look for a substring. It evaluates every group the way GitHub
does, for two simulated fork pull requests that share the branch ``patch-1``
(numbers 1 and 2), and asserts the two strings differ. A typo such as
``pull_request.numbr`` evaluates to null on GitHub -- not an error, and
actionlint does not type-check the payload -- so it is evaluated as null here
too, and the group collapses into one string shared by every pull request.

B3: a workflow whose ``types:`` include ``edited``, ``labeled`` or
``unlabeled`` gets a second run on the SAME head commit. Any group cancels one
of the two (``cancel-in-progress: false`` still cancels a replaced pending
run), the cancelled run stays in the rollup, and branch protection refuses the
merge (#399). Such a workflow has no ``concurrency:`` block at all.

A push to main keeps the group it had before the change: the table below is
the value each changed workflow evaluated to on main before #75 was fixed.
