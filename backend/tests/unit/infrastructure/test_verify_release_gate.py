"""`scripts/verify_release_gate.sh` against a fake `gh` (QA 3b).

The deploy refuses a tag whose commit did not pass the Release Gate. The lookup
it replaced read `commits/<sha>/check-runs` once, unfiltered: the API pages at
30, v0.2.7's commit carried 33 check runs, and the gate was on page 2 -- so a
passing release read as `Result=''` and a deploy could only ever be refused or,
depending on ordering, allowed for the wrong reason.

The fake below is a small model of the one endpoint the script calls: it
filters by `check_name` exactly as the API does, pages at `per_page` (default
30, as the API does), returns only the requested page unless `--paginate` is
given, and applies `--jq` with the real `jq` per page, as `gh` does. So a
script that drops the filter, or the pagination, meets the same 30-row cut-off
production would.

No git and no network: this runs in the ordinary unit job and in
`core_build.sh`'s copy of the tree.
