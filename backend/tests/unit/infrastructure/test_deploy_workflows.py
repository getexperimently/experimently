"""Deploy, Rollback and Database Migration: one path for staging and prod.

Static reads of the three workflows that act on AWS (`deploy.yml`,
`rollback.yml`, `db-migrate.yml`) and the composite action they share. None of
them has ever run against AWS from this repository, and none can run in CI
without an account -- so the properties the Stream B plan signed off on are
pinned here, each with the defect it exists to catch:

* one vocabulary, ``staging|prod``, as a closed choice, and no literal
  environment name anywhere else (D6, QA 4a);
* the account variable read only inside the environment-bound job's first
  step, never in a job-level ``if:`` or a workflow ``env:`` (PE v1 C9);
* no ``${{ }}`` interpolation inside any ``run:`` (PE v1 C11);
* tooling from the dispatch ref, which must be main; the release checked out
  into ``./release`` for the build only (PE v1 C6);
* a secret-free preflight and ONE environment-bound deploy job whose refusals
  all come before its first AWS mutation;
* the image pushed once as ``:<tag>-<profile>``, labelled with the commit
  actually built, and named by digest in every task definition registered
  (#71, #70, #138, QA 1c/2/10/11);
* a forward deploy that completes (#143, PE v2 C6-C8): it refuses while an
  earlier deployment is active, approves the shift only on healthy targets,
  with READY_WAIT, never stops a deployment and never waits for Succeeded,
  and succeeds on the one serving predicate (scripts/api_serving.py);
* the smoke test a real request through the public origin, inside the deploy
  job, with nothing installed (#144, PE v2 C10);
* the dashboard built with the API before anything changes, and rolled out
  after it (#69): its refusals among REFUSALS, its rollout script among
  MUTATIONS. The behaviour of those steps is driven with fakes in
  test_dashboard_deploy_wiring.py.

Unlike the older workflow tests these do NOT skip when a file is missing: a
tree that ships `.github/workflows` must ship these three, so a rename fails
here rather than turning into green skips (QA 4d).
