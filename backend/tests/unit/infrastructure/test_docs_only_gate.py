"""A docs-only pull request reports every required check -- and still runs the docs tests.

Branch protection requires ``core-build``, ``full-build`` and
``SDK Live Contract / sdk-live-contract (core)``. All three used to be skipped
by a job-level ``if: needs.changes.outputs.docs_only != 'true'`` and, unlike a
plain job, neither skip reported under the required name: ``core-build`` and
``full-build`` were then one matrix job, which skipped before it expands
reports once as the literal ``${{ matrix.profile }}-build``, and a skipped
reusable-workflow caller reports only as ``SDK Live Contract``. #133
(``docs/auth/sso.md`` only) sat BLOCKED with every check that ran green.

So those jobs always run and every STEP is conditioned instead. Since #869
the matrix is two plain jobs, ``core-build`` and ``full-build``, with the
steps each leg had and the profile written out. These are YAML reads, not
greps, and they pin the exact condition on every step, so a new step that is
not classified here fails until it is:

* ``core-build``: every build step ``docs_only != 'true'``; on a docs-only
  change it checks out, sets up Python and runs the tests that pin ``docs/``
  content (``DOCS_TESTS``);
* ``full-build``: every step but the printed reason ``docs_only != 'true'``,
  and no docs tests;
* the two jobs share their runner, timeout, services, environment and every
  step they both have, as the matrix legs did by construction;
* ``_platform.yml``: a ``skip`` input, every step's condition starting with
  ``!inputs.skip`` inside ``${{ }}`` (a bare leading ``!`` is a YAML tag);
* the three sources of the required check names;
* ``git diff --no-renames`` in the ``changes`` job, without which
  ``git mv backend/a.py docs/a.py`` lists only ``docs/a.py``.

The classification itself is tested in
``backend/tests/unit/scripts/test_classify_changes.py``.
