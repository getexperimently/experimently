"""Every required check has exactly one producer on a pull request's head commit (A10).

Branch protection matches a required check by NAME on the head commit. A
same-repository pull request's head commit collects check runs from two
events: ``pull_request``, and the ``push`` of its branch. If two jobs report
the same required name there -- two workflows, or one workflow fired by both
events -- protection can be satisfied by the one that is not the real gate.

``Leak Guard`` was exactly that: one job, triggered by ``push: ["**"]`` and by
``pull_request``, both reporting ``Leak Guard``. Only the pull_request run
reads the title and body. It now names itself per event
(``Leak Guard (push)`` on a push), and this test evaluates every job name per
event to keep it that way.

A job's own ``if:`` is not consulted: a skipped job still reports its name, and
protection accepts a skipped check. So splitting a job into two
event-conditioned jobs that share a name fails here, as it must.

Names come from ``REQUIRED_CHECKS`` in ``scripts/configure-repo.sh``, the list
that script writes to protection; matrix names and ``caller / callee (...)``
names of reusable workflows are expanded the way GitHub expands them.
