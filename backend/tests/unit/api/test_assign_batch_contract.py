"""The fixed parts of ``POST /api/v1/tracking/assign/batch`` (#441).

* the rate limit is its own (60 a minute), not the tracking prefix's, and the
  61st request in a minute is refused with 429 by the real middleware (the
  application turns the middleware off under test, so it is driven with
  ``enabled=True`` here, as ``test_own_password_rate_limit.py`` does);
* the two ``sdk:ruleset`` 403 texts, as literal strings: the other tests
  compare responses with the constants, a copy against a copy;
* ``AssignmentService.bulk_assign_users`` is gone: it skipped the holdout,
  mutual exclusion and targeting checks.
