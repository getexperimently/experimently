"""The dashboard's nginx sets its own Content-Security-Policy.

docs/security/threat-model.md lists it as an implemented control (#125: the
page used to recommend adding one). This pins what the page says: the header
is set at server level with `always`, so every location that sets no
`add_header` of its own inherits it; it starts from `default-src 'self'`,
forbids framing, and takes `connect-src` from `CSP_CONNECT_SRC`, which
frontend/docker-entrypoint.sh substitutes at start-up.

The two API reference pages are the exception (#817): `location =
/api/v1/docs` and `location = /api/v1/redoc` proxy to the API and carry the
API's own policy only, because a second, stricter policy would block the
assets Swagger UI and ReDoc load. nginx inherits server-level `add_header`
lines only into a location that has none of its own, so each of those blocks
must set at least one `add_header` and no Content-Security-Policy.
