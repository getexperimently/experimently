"""The Host header is attacker-controlled; these pin what we do about it (#220).

Three properties, and the second is the one that would have broken a
deployment rather than leaked anything:

  * a foreign Host is refused before any handler sees it;
  * the ALB's health probes are NOT refused, because they arrive with the
    target's own IP as Host and Starlette's TrustedHostMiddleware has no path
    exemption -- with that middleware and a correct ALLOWED_HOSTS the target
    group never turns healthy and the deploy rolls back with the app fine;
  * the OIDC redirect_uri does not move when the Host header does.
