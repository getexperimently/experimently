"""Exactly which routes require the ``sdk:ruleset`` API-key scope.

``require_sdk_ruleset_key`` (``backend/app/api/sdk_scope.py``) protects only
the routes that depend on it.  This pins the set, over every route of the
application: a route that stops requiring the scope, or a new one that starts,
fails ``test_the_scoped_routes_are_exactly_these`` until it is listed here.

Routes are read through ``effective_route_contexts`` (FastAPI keeps
``include_router`` lazy), as in ``test_flag_change_routes_guarded.py``.
