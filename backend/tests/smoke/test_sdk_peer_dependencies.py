"""A JS SDK never bundles the host library it plugs into (#76).

``@openfeature/server-sdk`` keeps its API in a module-level singleton. When
the provider declares it in ``dependencies`` and the application's own copy
resolves to a different version, npm nests a second copy under the provider:
``OpenFeature.setProvider`` then registers on one instance while the
application's ``OpenFeature.getClient()`` reads the other, and every flag
resolves through the NoopProvider -- default values, no error.

React has the same property (two copies break hooks), which is why the two
React SDKs already take it as a peer.

So each host library listed below must be:

* in ``peerDependencies``, with the documented range (a narrowed range
  refuses installs the docs promise will work);
* in ``devDependencies``, so the package's own build and tests have it;
* in none of ``dependencies``, ``optionalDependencies`` or
  ``bundleDependencies``;
* and the committed ``package-lock.json`` must say the same: its root entry
  agrees with the manifest, and the installed copy is marked ``dev`` (nothing
  in the runtime closure requires it).

``sdk/react-native`` is not listed. It also takes ``react`` and
``react-native`` as peers, but its runtime dependency
``@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`` peer-requires ``react-native``,
so its lock cannot mark them ``dev`` and the last check does not apply there.
