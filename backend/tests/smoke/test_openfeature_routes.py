"""The two deprecated definition listings are gone (#737, #228).

``GET /api/v1/edge/bootstrap`` and ``GET /api/v1/openfeature/flags`` were
deprecated in favour of ``GET /api/v1/sdk/ruleset`` (#226, #241) and are now
removed. This pins the removal three ways, because each one alone can pass
while the route still answers:

* the mounted route set, read through ``effective_route_contexts`` (as in
  ``test_flag_change_routes_guarded.py``): FastAPI keeps ``include_router`` as
  a lazy entry, so plain ``app.routes`` would see nothing at all, and a
  positive control proves the reader sees a route that is still mounted;
* the OpenAPI document, since a route mounted with ``include_in_schema=False``
  is absent there and still answers (the committed snapshots are pinned to
  the generator by ``test_openapi_snapshot.py``, so this does not read them);
* a request with a valid API key, which must get exactly 404. A 401 or 403
  would mean the route is still mounted and only refusing the key.
