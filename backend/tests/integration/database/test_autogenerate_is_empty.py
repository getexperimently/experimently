"""``alembic revision --autogenerate`` against a fresh database proposes nothing.

One property, and it is the one that catches this whole class of bug before it
is pushed: **bootstrap a database, ask alembic what has changed, and the answer
must be "nothing"**.  Every operation alembic proposes there is either a
migration somebody forgot to write or -- three times now -- a comparison
pointed at the wrong thing, and the second kind is destructive:

* *review round 3, finding 1.*  ``include_schemas=True`` made autogenerate
  reflect the application schema, which ``env.py`` named from
  ``POSTGRES_SCHEMA`` (default ``"experimentation"``) while ``target_metadata``
  named it from ``APP_ENV`` (``test_experimentation`` under the export sequence
  ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` documents).  The generated revision created all ~50 tables in
  one schema and ran ``op.drop_table`` on all ~50 in the other -- ``users``,
  ``experiments``, ``feature_flags``, everything.
* *review round 3, finding 2.*  Nothing filtered the twelve module tables, nine
  of which core-chain revisions create, so a **core** checkout proposed twelve
  ``op.drop_table`` calls against a database that has them.  Applied to a
  full-profile database that is every workspace, SSO configuration, BAA and PHI
  audit row.
* the schema translation itself.  The bootstrap used to move the models onto
  ``POSTGRES_SCHEMA`` by assigning ``table.schema``, which leaves each table's
  key and every auto-generated index name derived from the *old* schema; the
  database then held ``ix_test_experimentation_*`` indexes inside schema
  ``experimentation`` and autogenerate proposed dropping and re-creating all 67.

The test runs for **both profiles** (a core checkout is a tree with no
``modules/``; ``tree_profiles.py`` builds one) and asserts on the operations in
the generated revision, never on the exit status -- all three bugs above exited
0 and wrote a file.
