"""Every way a database can move between the profiles, and where it lands.

Four transitions, one test each, each asserting the same two things about the
**end state**: the exact rows in ``alembic_version``, and whether the two
``workspace_id`` foreign keys are there.  Those two are what every regression in
this area has damaged, and they are cheap to state exactly.

    1. fresh **full** bootstrap
    2. fresh **core**, then switched to full by ``alembic upgrade heads``
    3. a database at the **pre-release** revision, upgraded with ``heads``
    4. a **core** build opened against a full-bootstrapped database

and two limits on what a transition may do: the reconcile that finishes (2)
creates module tables and nothing else (5), and only ``upgrade`` may answer (4)
by succeeding having done nothing -- ``downgrade`` and ``stamp`` may not (6).

The difference from ``test_profile_migrations.py``, which covers some of the
same ground, is *how* the core side is produced: that file simulates a core
checkout by pointing an alembic ``Config`` at one version location, which
cannot exercise ``migrations/env.py`` -- the file the guard and the reconcile
live in -- from a genuinely modules-free interpreter.  This one builds a real
tree with no ``modules/`` (``tree_profiles.core_tree``) and runs the documented
commands in it, as a container would.

Why the documented commands and not ``db/bootstrap.py``: review round 3 found
that ``alembic upgrade heads`` -- what ``docs/self-hosting/migrations.md``,
``deploy-prod.yml`` and ``infrastructure/cdk/stacks/migration_task_stack.py``
all run -- completed transition 2 only half way (three of the twelve module
tables created, both revisions stamped, nothing left to retry, and
``/workspaces``, ``/hipaa/*`` and ``/auth/sso/*`` answering 500 on
``UndefinedTable``) and failed transition 4 outright with ``CommandError: Can't
locate revision identified by 'modules_0001_rbac'``, which is the ECS migration
task's exit code and so the deploy job's.
