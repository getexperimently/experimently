"""``modules_0002_warehouse_analysis`` across every database it can meet (#312).

The revision creates the three warehouse-analysis tables and removes the
earlier ``warehouse_connections`` table with its rows.  It is the first module
revision that deletes data, so each way a database can reach it is rehearsed
here as the deployment runs it -- raw ``alembic upgrade heads`` in a
subprocess, which is what the ECS migration task does -- and each end state is
stated exactly: the ``alembic_version`` rows, the shape of the three tables
against what the models build, and where the earlier rows went.

    1. a database a core bootstrap built, opened by this full build
       (no ``warehouse_connections`` at all);
    2. a database the previous full release migrated, with saved connections
       (the earlier table, populated), and that release put back afterwards;
    3. the earlier rows: gone, active and inactive, from every table;
    4. a downgrade and a re-upgrade: a table the bootstrap built, holding a
       connection, is not taken for the earlier one;
    5. the downgrade of a table this revision created puts the earlier shape
       back, empty, so the previous release maps a table again.

"The shape" is compared from the catalogue -- columns and their types and
nullability, every constraint's definition (CHECK constraints included, which
``alembic --autogenerate`` never compares), every index's definition -- against
a reference schema a fresh full bootstrap built from the models.
