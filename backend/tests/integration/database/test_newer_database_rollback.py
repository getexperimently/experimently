"""An older build meeting a database a newer release migrated: a rollback.

The rehearsal from the self-hosting plan's review (#238), as a test.  Release
N+1 is this tree plus one more core revision -- ``down_revision`` = this tree's
core head -- that creates a table, exactly what the next release to carry a
migration will look like.  The database is built by N, upgraded by N+1, and
then N starts against it again, which is what ``helm rollback`` or a re-pinned
image tag does.

N cannot resolve N+1's revision, so it must refuse -- exit non-zero, before
alembic touches anything -- and say what happened: *a newer release migrated
this database; run that release or restore the pre-upgrade backup*.  It used to
say "a database built by the full profile being opened by a core build ...
delete those rows from alembic_version", which was the wrong diagnosis and
harmful advice: deleting the row leaves N+1's table in place and unrecorded,
the next N run re-applies migrations over it, and rolling forward to N+1 again
dies on ``DuplicateTable``.

Both documented paths are exercised, because both reach the same guard: the
bootstrap the container runs on start-up, and the raw ``alembic upgrade
heads`` that ``deploy.yml`` and the ECS migration task run.  In-process
subprocesses rather than ``docker run``: the property is the bootstrap's, the
trees are built the way ``tree_profiles`` builds them for the other transition
tests, and a subprocess is what a container is to this code.

The refusal belongs to the bootstrap and to ``alembic upgrade heads``.  The
second test is the other half (#298): a deployment whose containers start with
``RUN_MIGRATIONS=false`` runs neither, so rolling back to N means N's **API**
serving the database N+1 migrated.  With a backward-compatible N+1 -- the only
kind a rollback without a restore can rely on -- N must come up ready and
answer a database-backed route as it normally does, not with a 500.
