"""A paused experiment stays paused until it is started or a resume is scheduled (#436).

Before the fix the scheduler activated every PAUSED experiment whose
``start_date`` had passed -- which is every experiment that ever ran -- so a
pause lasted until the next tick, and the scheduler ticks once at startup. A
resume scheduled with ``PUT /schedule`` was stored by overwriting
``start_date``, and a later manual pause was undone by that same stale date.

Now a resume on a PAUSED experiment is its own column, ``resume_at``:

* P1  a paused experiment with a past ``start_date`` and no resume stays paused;
* P2  ``PUT /schedule`` on a PAUSED experiment records ``resume_at`` (in the
      response and on a later GET), leaves ``start_date`` alone, and the tick
      resumes it, clears ``resume_at`` and says "resumed automatically";
* P3  a resume in the future is not fired early;
* P4  a manual pause after a resume leaves nothing pending, whichever writer
      pauses it (the sequence pause, schedule, start, pause, tick);
* P5  every other status change clears a scheduled resume, through every
      writer that has a route, the two service-only methods, and an instance
      expired by a commit;
* P6  a due DRAFT still activates, with "started automatically";
* P7  ``PUT /schedule`` on a DRAFT experiment sets no ``resume_at``, and a
      field the request omits is left unchanged (#482);

plus the refusals ``PUT /schedule`` on PAUSED makes from the values the
experiment would end up with (400, never a constraint error), what happens to
each field the request omits (on DRAFT too, #482), how ``time_zone`` reads a
date without an offset and refuses a name that is not an IANA zone (#483),
the 400 text for an ACTIVE experiment, and the
hazard the rollback note describes: without the listener, ``POST /start`` on a
paused experiment with a pending resume is a 500.

Every request is a real one: real ``User`` rows, a real local JWT from
``create_local_access_token``, and no dependency override except
``deps.get_db``. ``make_client_for_user`` is deliberately not used (#470).
The scheduler runs against the same database with its ``SessionLocal``
patched, as ``test_experiment_bayesian_config_api.py`` does. The database is
shared with other tests, so the tick's own counts are not asserted; which
experiments it activated is read from the notifications it sends.
