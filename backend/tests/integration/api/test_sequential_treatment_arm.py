"""
The sequential analysis compares the control against the same treatment arm
on every call (#929).

``Experiment.variants`` had no ``order_by``, so PostgreSQL returned the rows
in their physical order: the insertion order on a fresh table, but a row
rewritten later in the heap moves to the end, and a plain ``ANALYZE`` can
change the plan and with it the order.  ``_get_sequential_data`` takes "the
first treatment" from that list, so on an experiment with three or more arms
``GET /results/{id}/sequential``, and the block ``GET /results/{id}`` embeds,
could compare the control against a different arm from one call to the next.
The relationship is now ordered by ``created_at`` then ``id``.

Two layouts put the treatment created first AFTER the other treatment in the
heap.  ``inserted_later`` inserts it last, with an earlier ``created_at``.
``rewritten_later`` inserts the rows in creation order and then rewrites the
first treatment's row (deleted and inserted again, unchanged, in one
statement), which is where an UPDATE that cannot reuse the row's place puts
it.  Each layout is asserted as a precondition on the bare query, so a
database that happened to return creation order fails the precondition
instead of passing the test by luck.

Real rows and the real ``AnalysisService``: three variants, one primary
conversion metric, distinct user counts per arm so the arm compared shows in
``confidence_sequence.sample_size``.
