"""No Lambda test may open a network connection to anything but loopback.

A pytest plugin, loaded for every session rooted at the repository root by
``conftest.py`` there (``pytest_plugins``), like ``no_real_aws``. Its fixture
is autouse but acts only on tests whose file lies under ``backend/lambda/`` or
``modules/lambda/``: every Lambda suite, including one added later, is covered
without its conftest having to opt in -- and the Lambda packages could not
import it anyway, since ``backend/lambda/.importlinter`` forbids them to import
``backend``.

Why: the Lambda functions build real boto3 clients on a cold start. A test
that forgets to stub one of them does not fail. ``no_real_aws`` gives it dummy
credentials, the request goes to the real AWS endpoint, AWS answers
``InvalidAccessKeyId``, and the handler under test catches that and carries on
(#433: the event processor's handler tests sent ``PutObject`` to S3 on every
run). The test stays green; it is merely slower, and depends on the network.

What it does, for the duration of each Lambda test: ``socket.socket.connect``
and ``connect_ex`` refuse an ``AF_INET``/``AF_INET6`` address that is not
loopback. The call raises :class:`OutboundNetworkBlocked`, so nothing leaves
the machine and the test fails there and then; it is a ``BaseException`` so
that the ``except Exception`` and retry loops in the code under test do not
absorb it. The attempt is also recorded and the test fails at teardown with
the address it tried to reach, so even code that catches ``BaseException``
cannot turn it into a pass.

Loopback stays allowed (moto's server mode, LocalStack on 127.0.0.1), as do
Unix-domain sockets. ``backend/tests`` is deliberately not covered: its
integration tests reach PostgreSQL and Redis by service host name in CI.

What it cannot see: a connection made below Python's ``socket`` module (a C
library such as libpq opening its own socket), a DNS lookup (it blocks the
connect that follows, not the ``getaddrinfo``), and a subprocess.

It must stay importable with only pytest installed (tests/sdk-contract loads
the root conftest that way).
