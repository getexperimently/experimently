"""The demo seeds are development-only.

``seed_demo_data.py``, ``seed_shoplab.py`` and ``seed_streampulse.py`` fill a
database with sample users, experiments and flags for the demo apps. They run
when ``ENVIRONMENT`` is ``development`` or ``test`` and stop at once, before
touching the database, anywhere else. ``backend/docker-entrypoint.sh`` makes
the same check on ``SEED=`` before it waits for the database; this is the same
rule for someone who runs a script by hand.

``seed_sdk_contract.py`` is not covered: it creates only the fixtures the SDK
contract suites assert on.
